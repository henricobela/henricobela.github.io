We are proud of the project's growth in this period of time, which in turn requires short-term advances from our partnership.
 With the flexibility of the rules imposed by the pandemic, field work is once again our ally, and consultant Cristina Lewaschim has contributed to the motivational work, through actions and campaigns with our customers and vendors.

 Another protocol, 210812-000091, this was lack of 1 LATEX CLASSICA A2 CAN, which was not delivered to the store, the carrier even opened a call, but it was stopped because they sent an email that does not accept a response, so I asked to transfer the call to me, I made the return note, and then they informed me that I was with the sector to make the collection, but then I said that I did not receive the goods that cannot be returned....now the protocol is with the ""responsible sector"".

 The worst problem to be solved is the SAC."

1035;10;Tradition and trustworthy company.
1036;9;For being a quality product, but it has other products with more interesting cost-benefits.
1037;8;BRAND RELIABILITY
1038;10;one of the things that I see being a problem at BASF is the service model, where we have 2 to 3 RTVs serving in the same region and sometimes even from different regions, this causes an internal fight where our biggest competitor becomes BASF itself, I suggest that this channel service model be reviewed, so that we can grow together and fight with other companies, not among ourselves.
1039;9;Reliable products.
1040;8;I would recommend it, as long as it makes sense to the customer.
1041;10;I have no doubts about the quality of BASF products, but the logistical and commercial team needs to be a little more flexible when problems arise, especially when the customer gets in touch directly asking for support.
1042;8;Prompt support in case of need, technical knowledge and agility in actions.
1043;8;The services and products meet my needs.
1044;10;The organization has an excellent commercial service aligned with the quality and guarantee of its products and services in a satisfactory way to strengthen the partnership.
1045;9;The grade 8 was given because the grade 10 does not exist, we always have to improve, and not 7 because I think the Basf portfolio is one of the most complete in the market.
1046;10;A serious and sustainable company.
1047;9;"In addition to knowing Basf for a long time, as well as the partnership we have globally, the difference lies in the team that serves Hanon Systems in Brazil, especially Ronaldo Cardozo who always keeps in touch with us, seeking to meet all our needs and also support with the launch of the new project and also assisting us commercially in all areas of planning, demands and others.
 Congratulations once again for the differentiated support and all the help in our new project in Brazil."

 They do not offer the customer product and/or volumes (doses) beyond what is necessary.
 Employees who respect security protocols (Covid 19)."
1052;8;Fantastic company.
1053;8;I assess this grade for the quality of the products, but in the current market situation, the delay for some items has harmed some punctual sales.
1054;8;BASF products are suitable for use, meaning they always work well.
1055;10;"The company Canquerini e Basf has a consolidated partnership for years.
 The Basf company has given the necessary support so that we can meet our customers' demand and thus become excellence in the market."

1067;10;I like the relationship with BASF, it is a flexible company to deal with commercially and always willing to help. I didn't give it a 10 because I believe we can improve in a global relationship and price could be a little more competitive.

1120;8;"I believe that there is a lack of a better alignment for distributions, we have resellers that are not BASF selling BASF products, we have a very large price dispersion in the producer which consequently has brought bad margins for distribution.

 Another thing is the development of some tool to help control the expiration date of products. For large networks like ours, this control becomes more difficult with each passing day."

1214;8;"I like working with Basf, but the negotiation method is very slow;
 While other companies already quote with the prices they want to close without wasting time, Basf informs higher prices to negotiate and when we agree the prices there are some more details to be settled (Ex. when you place the final order, there are prices for some products lower and others higher ) but in the last line the value is equal to the closing, but to manage this in the system it is complicated

 Delay in the delivery of orders after closing;

 Shortages;

 Product delivery delay"

 Another protocol, 210812-000091, this was lack of 1 LATEX CLASSICA A2 CAN, which was not delivered to the store, the carrier even opened a call, but it was stopped because they sent an email that does not accept a response, so I asked to transfer the call to me, I made the return note, and then they informed me that I was with the sector to make the collection, but then I said that I did not receive the goods that cannot be returned....now the protocol is with the ""responsible sector"".

 The worst problem to be solved is the SAC."

1267;9;I see the effort of the field team to try to make business viable, even though the company is quite rigid in its policies and providing few resources for regionalized actions.

1304;8;We would like more support for document requests. There is always feedback for requests, however, it usually takes place over a long period of time, as a lot of information is available at the head office (Germany) and local contacts do not have access. Some local distributors' business or issue resolution ends up waiting for BASF's international application process.

 Delay in product delivery;
 Basf products on the market lower than our prices so we lost sales;
 He comments that prices are special for closed Cooperatives, but we often realize that this is not the case because many Distributors and open Cooperatives have better prices than Capal, it's been 3 years;
 When we make complaints, the feedback is not immediate and when they return it is not conclusive and we realize that they take the matter until the end of the harvest;
 We see unfair competition in the market, but the most difficult thing is when you lose sales for the same product not for a similar one (BASF x BASF)

 * To improve only the Dispersion part, we would need to have the same form of payment (60 days) that we handle with the construction part, it would be very important for us, and for you too, because we could evaluate larger purchases, otherwise it would be difficult For us, we are already making a great effort to achieve 60 days in the Acronal 1541 raw material, for that we raised the bet to buy in Bulk, in the same way we would like to have the same number of days for the other products.
 Another important issue with Dispersions, in recent months we find ourselves with slow deliveries, and although the seller always responded, orders that we had were not delivered in time and forms, which brought us a delay and complications to meet our customers, complications when producing, since without even having a confirmed date it was very difficult to move forward.

These are generally different from Basf, but they always seek to achieve the targets imposed by the customer. In addition to always proposing new ideas, new scenarios, explaining market trends. The Basf team is lean, which can be difficult at times due to internal workload issues, and generally employees give 120% ~ 150% to serve the customer. It is not an ideal practice, failures or delays may occur, but it shows commitment to activities.
3570;9;If I would recommend them, good service, very good understanding of the business and interpersonal relationships. Long-term relationship as a supplier.

3580;8;Good service and tradition. Current weakness is the discontinuity of supply due to the leak problem in Germany and the news that BASF plans a strategic stop for October or November 2021.

4068;10;Very organized company, with great service.
4069;10;BASF is an excellent company in many aspects, such as technology, innovation, customer relations, etc.
4070;8;product quality.
4071;9;Quality in commercial technical service and plant protection product lines. The grade could be higher, but we already face a lack of products and annually we face deliberate price increases, although explained by the sales team, it does not justify the business strategy.
4072;8;"This grade is 8 for not knowing which one is my friend. If you are a competitor who can confront my company in the market.
 if it is from a far away place the grade would change to 10"
4073;9;Quality of products and services

4075;10;Excellent customer service and appreciation.
4076;9;Solutions that meet different farming situations, good technical support and service team
4077;9;serious company
4078;9;Basf in summary is an excellent company to work for, its portfolio, its sales team are very good, however I see a great weakness in relation to the management of cutting-edge prices (Farm Gate). Pricing problems are common with any Player, but Basf lost this control, since it is the worst company ... it managed to be worse than Bayer
4079;9;The pricing policy could be better, bringing a better COST / BENEFIT ratio and, in this way, we could have a better Technical Commercial Strategy for the use of these products in our members.
4080;8;Reliability and proven agronomic result.
4081;8;Excellent portfolio, broad and high quality. The second point is the excellent service provided by account manager Cesar Proti to Agrex. This excellent service extends to Basf's RTV's, which are technically well prepared and provide all the necessary support for our entire sales team.
4082;8;Partner company.
4083;8;Reliable company, with excellent products and easy negotiation, in addition to technical sales representatives always present and willing to help us.
4084;10;concern that BASF has with the company, in terms of stock and always with the seller
4085;10;BASF is the main partner within the channel, but there will always be some impasses, whether strategic or commercial, so what matters is always to align.
4086;9;Product quality and excellent service!

4098;8;Excellence in products and after sales
4099;9;Serious company that follows its policies.
4100;10;I just think there's things to improve. Deliveries for example are very time consuming. Another thing when a client makes Barter, Basf is delivering chopped product, in parts. While the biggest market holder called Syngenta delivers everything at once to its customers.
4101;9;Reference company in the Brazilian agricultural market and with products of high quality and efficiency
4102;10;Service with seriousness and ethics, focusing on the result of the farmer.

Despite putting a 10 we do not agree with the collection forms for two reasons: a) once instead of 30 days we paid in 45 days and they sent us a debit note for interest of 80 thousand pesos. It seems to me a warning would have been better and before repetitive cases we would understand it. b) charging VAT on debit notes also seems wrong to us

 The grade 8 is given by the portfolio that the company presents to the market, which is very robust and meets the most varied recommendations in the field; the score is not 9 because it is not complete due to the time we live in agriculture, where rotating active principles is the most viable and correct recommendation.

4513;8;I have been a partner of Basf for some time and I have a great relationship with the company

4515;8;Quality products, good service, wide product mix.
4516;9;For the tradition and quality of the products
4517;10;"The trust that the Basf company gives is certainly its best quality.

 However, I say, with longstanding knowledge, that the company does not offer freedom for the field performance team to remain 100% focused on the field.

 Unfortunately, the internal demands of several consultants, who have passed through our region, make clear the company's policy towards internal work, as it is extremely massive and takes a lot of time from precious people who work on the ""store floor""."

 Did you need it? Can count !!"
4808;8;Tradition and credibility
4809;8;It is a good company, although sometimes they are more expensive in prices compared to what is in the market ...
4810;9;Product and service quality, support to the needs of our business in accordance with the international and national context of the markets.
4811;9;BASF is a huge company, but it serves its customers very closely and quickly.
4812;10;Partnership and agility
4813;9;Good support in new product developments, support in searching for solutions and professional knowledge.
4814;10;I have several years of experience with BASF as a supplier,
4815;8;Today, one of the most important things to retain a customer is service and agility in the processes. Thiago, Enderson, Caio and other collaborators who work directly with us have a great influence on this note. In addition to the quality of Suvinil products that is second to none.
4816;8;Basf is a company aligned with the same purposes that I share.
4817;9;The company has several service channels, so communication between consumer and manufacturer is easier and more agile
4818;10;A great product... cost-effective... using a paint that lasts longer... the longer it would take for the painting professional to return to your home... the more you save...
4819;9;quality and punctuality.
4820;10;"Helo!
 In general, BASF is one of the best suppliers to work for, for the organization, assistance and participation with the company.
 There is only the suggestion for improvements that can be made in relation to the negotiation with Suvinil, and with the distribution that is sometimes very fragmented, several notes issued sometimes every day of the week arrive with a truck with 10 to 15 volumes only. Wiping off this big flow and compressing on less load would be more efficient for everyone!"
4821;8;Credibility
4822;8;Commitment to the customer!
4823;10;The result of a positive experience of over 30 years working with Basf products, the Suvinil brand for me is synonymous with quality in paints and mainly for the support and interaction with the sales and marketing team.
4824;9;Quality, service!
4825;10;Due to the quality of the products!
4826;9;Reliability, quality and technology.
4827;9;Service, transparency, partnership.

4832;8;Due to the seriousness and quality of the products that the company offers,
4833;9;I am always well attended. Sometimes there is a delay in receiving technical assistance ref.
4834;8;Well my recommendation will always be with my eyes closed because I've been working with Td line from basf for over 15 years in addition to seriousness, good technical service and market credibility and I'm also suspicious in talking because the region I visit predominates in the suvinil line in tds these years I just have to thank you guys!
4835;8;reliable company in quality products and negotiation
4836;9;Company that works with good quality products.
4837;10;"Good quality products but prices a little above the market.

 Technical Assistance is lacking, with regard to taking on problems, Very good technicians, but wrong protocols with paints that are causing reoccurrences of cloud problems, among others, and products that do not accompany the expansion of walls in external paintings."
4838;10;the company has a strong name in the market and seriousness in its products
4839;9;In relation to Suvinil, superior quality to other brands and differentiated service!
4840;8;Relationship
4841;9;I believe that BASF is an excellent company, but it leaves a little to be desired in the relationship with the customer. It generates little value for the customer (shopkeeper).
4842;10;Confidence in the brand.
4843;8;"I have been a basf customer for over 30 years.
 I trust the brand"
4844;9;Leading brand in the market, recognized and valued by the customer.
4845;10;Service par excellence
4846;8;Quality and tradition! Product sells itself.
4847;9;Company would be, and has excellent quality products
4848;9;It is a company with a very good team and committed to its customers.
4849;10;Excellent quality products.
4850;10;Products and mix are the best in the market, excellent service, sales consultant always willing to help, immense ease of contact with Suvinil technician.
4851;10;Suvinil is indispensable in the inkjet business.
4852;10;High quality products and technology
4853;10;Products with excellent performance, improved service in recent months.
4854;9;Because we've been together for 22 years with Basf, we started from scratch and thanks to our work and support, transparency in negotiations, the reputable brand and leader in our state, we managed to achieve growth over these years from 2003 to the year of 2019.
4855;10;"I understand this is a serious company. And that, in addition to focusing on its business, always innovating, it has great concern and care for people.
 Employees, customers, consumers and professionals!"
4856;8;Returns via dispatch makes the work of CDs very difficult. We receive loads from many suppliers on the same day and there is no time to wait on the phone until we are answered. It would make it easier to be able to open these tickets by email.
4857;10;"as I've been selling paints for over 30 years, I know and sold several brands and I remember that when I started selling Suvinil the sales gave a fantastic UP and I still see undisputed quality, durability and yield well above the others and excellent cost-benefit. that's what I recommend without a shadow of a doubt.

 I am sure of the quality of the products, technical and commercial support.
 Combinations of 2 or more molecules that make it less versatile when defining doses according to situations are not convenient and the minimum number of hectares of some packs makes them inefficient.
 Average yields in Entre Ríos are lower and more erratic than the core zones. Due to the type of soil, the doses used are mostly the maximum. And very small economic units, so it is always a higher percentage of the margin that goes into inputs. Some companies have already understood it and are rewarded for being a more marginal area.

5126;9;BASF provides good service, but I also believe that there is always room for improvement.
5127;10;Credibility and quality.
5128;9;The reason for this note, is due to the commercial service always available and promoting better prices and consolidating the partnership. Another point to include is technical support on products as well as innovations.

5169;8;I consider it to be an extraordinary line of products, in my case, for urban pest control. I do not get to 10 for a simple reason: I think that the internal processes of the company are very time consuming (I don't know what the reason is but they take a long time) compared to other competitors that exist in the market. A second reason is because the sales team in this division has very few people. I think that with some other people with a scheme of greater proximity to the client, the line can be even more attractive.
5170;9;The Products in general are very good and offer some different alternatives to those of the Competition !!!!.

5330;8;I ALWAYS RECOMMEND SUVINIL BECAUSE I CONSIDER THE BEST INK ON THE MARKET.
5331;10;Because, the quality of Basf's products always exceeds all expectations.
5332;9;The reason for my note, follows the reasoning of the specification given in the previous question, where we know all the quality of BASF products, but at the same time we realize that the prices are very far from the existing competitors in the market, thus making marketing difficult.
5333;8;We've always had a good relationship with the company.

5354;9;BECAUSE YOUR PRODUCTS ARE FIRST QUALITY
5355;8;besides the quality, the colors are beautiful.
5356;9;WE NEED BASF'S BIGGEST SUPPORT WITH OUR PAINTERS INSTRUCTING BETTER ABOUT THE APPLICATION AND USE OF PRODUCTS, AND AS A DISCOUNT FOR CASH PAYMENT IN OTHER COMPANIES WE HAVE ON average A PERCENTAGE OF 4 TO 5% THAT HELPS TO HAVE A BETTER MARGIN IN US PRODUCTS AND A MORE COMPETITIVE PRICE
5357;10;I FEEL DESPRESTIGIATED ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE PRICE WAR WITH INDIRECTLY SERVED CUSTOMERS.
5358;9;A long partnership with basf, and good physical service, technicians and salespeople
5359;10;A brand that conveys confidence and allows us to indicate without fear of being disappointed with the result.

5365;10;Only because of the price, in the market there are alternatives of better prices and of similar quality.
5366;10;It is a company with a broad portfolio to meet the needs of its clients at good costs and excellent quality.
5367;8;"Company with exceptional technology, market recognition of excellence in products. I miss technical support a little, especially in the ""partnership"" item. Considering a manufacturer's relationship with a distributor I would say I would expect more. From a commercial point of view, the deal is fluid and dynamic."
5368;8;Great products and fast delivery.
5369;9;I would definitely indicate, as Basf is undoubtedly a partner company.

5378;9;It is a serious, solid company, partner, with a very good team of professionals, prepared for the market.
5379;10;For the satisfaction I have in working with basf!!
5380;9;BASF is a solid, reliable supplier with supply conditions in line with the market. A partner that we currently count on and that we would recommend as a supplier.
5381;9;I have had very good experiences with you, in each project I feel supported and backed, in terms of technical and logistics.
5382;8;My rating is 8 because the service is very good, although the prices in many cases can exceed and lately there are no new technologies.

5390;9;It is a comprehensive company, with a good portfolio of products, quality and service
5391;8;Except for some details, it is a very reliable supplier, an excellent product and good attention from its representatives.
5392;10;We are united by a tradition of work for more than 40 years of activity. We have jointly developed materials that maintain dominance in the market. Because of the trust that a supplier of the size of BASF gives us and vice versa as clients complementing us, evolving and growing our businesses. Due to their HR, who have displayed knowledge, professionalism, vocation, drive, attention, they have achieved a synergy with our team, achieving an amalgam, making us feel that we are part of BASF
5393;9;Orders are delivered in a timely manner, the quality is always as expected and if logistical problems arise outside of the Company, every effort is made to try to find solutions.
5394;8;Standard of excellence in customer service.
5395;9;Service and commitment
5396;9;Excellent technical and commercial team, but prices are still high since they are dollarized, and we can hardly keep the values in local currencies for at least 3 months
5397;10;The contact with the employees who serve us is a little difficult, some emails are not answered, and the phone is difficult to contact.
5398;10;BASF has excellent products, which align with current technologies, providing safety and good performance in use.
5399;8;VERY GOOD QUALITY PRODUCTS, HUMAN RESOURCE WITH HUMAN QUALITY
5400;8;because the service and customer care has improved

5425;10;I'm very satisfied with the company.
5426;9;excellent organization, product quality and excellent service regarding product schedules.
5427;10;My contact with BASF is in the import sector, and in my area, contact and response to requests are always well attended and resolved in the best way.
5428;10;As suppliers at a general level they are excellent, the points indicated as the best are in pursuit of continuous improvement, but I attest to the commitment and work carried out in recent months to achieve better support each time. I would like to highlight Ana Laura Gonzalez who, upon noticing these delays and small inconsistencies in the checking account, led the management and helped provide a response and solution to each requirement.
5429;8;High quality products, good technical response from their representatives.
5430;10;The customer service is excellent, the treatment is always super cordial, but since we proceeded to accept the issuance of ND, the administrative, accounting, and billing part has become chaos, since the systems of both companies are different.
5431;9;In general, their products are very good, the only thing that they have always had to improve is that order deliveries are extremely delayed for us as distributors, which sometimes results in a breach on the part of us to the end customer.
5432;10;Good products, with good technical advice.
5433;10;"Improvement opportunities:
 - It should be improved the way that the inclusion of companies (of the same group) for billing, especially with regional agreements, does not depend on a lot of paperwork and restrictions.
 - It would be good to have the modification of the VOLLEY re-entry period, so that it is reviewed / adjusted (unless) in the shortest possible time with the responsible government entity, so as not to generate a complex variable within the operation."
5434;9;Very good attention, either by the area representative and the technician.
5435;9;For the quality of products and developments.
5436;10;"THE ATTENTION GIVEN BY THE SELLER, MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.
 EXCELLENT QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS.
 CONSISTENT PRICES AND PAYMENT DEADLINES."
5437;10;We have been since BASF settled in Uruguay, already proven to be a serious and responsible company and that generates a trust by which we continue to walk together. We do not score a 10 because there are always little things to improve!
5438;10;"PRODUCT QUALITY
 INNOVATION
 ADEQUATE COMMERCIAL ATTENTION.
 TRAINING PROPOSALS.
 CLOSE AND ACCESS TO REFERENTS"
5439;8;gives me confidence
5440;10;I GIVE THIS SCORE FOR LACK OF MORE TECHNICAL TRAINING

5449;10;"The products are of very good quality, but the price in some lines is not very competitive, having to resort to another brand for the customer to decide.
 The technical service and the preparation of colors, very good. Although, once again, the price of ready-made paint is very high in certain colors."
5450;9;I have good results
5451;9;Very good products and sales service, but in the technical part we often run out of support and the distance with Buenos Aires hurts us, since it costs us to get courses for our clients. Better attention is lacking in credits, since you can only communicate by mail, it is impossible to speak with someone in that area, at least they would have to have a WhatsApp number that respond more quickly,
5452;10;quality and attention of the technician and seller
5453;9;The products are good, the brand is recognized in the market.

6316;9;For the excellent technical and commercial service.
6317;8;The reason for the certainty of recommendation is that today the BASF company is a reference in the world within the markets that it operates and maintains in Brazil a high-level technical and commercial body that serves us in a pleasant and competent manner. After the initial discussion, which is usually linked to technical results, we do not need to be sure of closing deals, as another discussion will be about costs and in this line of thought we understand that it is always interesting to take our needs for analysis by the BASF team.

6328;9;The products are great, but the response times are very slow. Businesses are more dynamic and on many occasions we lose opportunities due to slow responses. I don't think it's the people, it's the internal processes or the work overload

6626;9;"In general evaluation it can be said that the service is very good, they have very good materials and very good technical assistance. They generally serve the customer's need with speed and efficiency and most of the team is highly trained to carry out the task. Today it can be said that they have the best technical assistance in the plant. From the management, they provide quick solutions that meet the needs of both day-to-day and new developments.
 As opportunities for improvement:

All teams involved at BASF, from operational to higher level, spared no effort so that their client would not have a line stop problem. What was protected was fulfilled to solve your customer's problem. Material arrived in time so that we didn't have trouble in our line. But I still can't give a 10 because I would like to see the 8D response dynamics meeting our specific Req deadline. In other words, all complaints with Basf do not meet our standard 10-day action plan.

7361;9;"Quality, recognized and reliable brand.
 They just need to improve the supply a little."
7362;10;Although BASF offers first-rate products, the commercial conditions are not entirely advantageous when competing with manufacturers in China and India who quote competitive prices and longer payment terms.
7363;9;BASF is a Company with high quality standards in its products and processes, therefore it is a recognized brand in the Ecuadorian market with important contributions to the industry, especially in the shrimp segment.

7396;8;I consider BASF to be a company with a range of products of excellent quality and technical support
7397;9;Service, Monitoring and quality of products.
7398;10;Excellent portfolio
7399;10;High quality products, effective for pest and disease control. Important support.
7400;10;They are products of very high quality and affordable prices for farmers.
7401;10;good products
7402;8;Basf is a leading company, with great technical experience and high quality products. However, the products of the competitors, which technically work well for us, have had over the last few months, particularly in relation to our company, which are polyamides, a more attractive price offer for which they have not been taken out new purchases.
7403;9;They are very good at serving their clients in a timely manner.
7404;8;The products are of good quality, there are no faults. Sometimes local needs are neglected

7412;9;For BASF to recommend it, you must know it fully and be sure that that friend or colleague is as much a generator of trust and respect as the one who recommends it.
7413;10;The staff is always willing to help and collaborate in search of improvement proposals. The main thing when one makes the purchase, is not only the quality of the product but the attention of the staff.
7414;8;It is a Company that has a fairly broad portfolio for our needs, and therefore, one of the most important in our company. Despite the difficulties along the way, they are always ready to solve to fulfill our requirements.
7415;10;I believe that BASF has a wide portfolio of top quality raw materials for various industries, it is a company that is very concerned about the environment.
7416;10;Wide portfolio and quality

8545;10;BASF has always enjoyed an impeccable reputation. In the more recent past, we have been having quality problems (which is quite true, we had the support of the BASF commercial team in the search for compensation), which compromised part of the evolution we were having with our customers in relation to the sale of high-value products aggregate. We still don't have the stability we need with BASF Latex. Thanks.
8546;9;I have known Basf for over 20 years and have always been one of our partners in this factory. This comment fits the Coating line. Lately we are having some quality problems with Latex for paint which is causing us serious inconvenience. But knowing the potential of the professionals and structure that are there, they will solve this problem.

8634;8;Agility in customer service.
8635;10;It is a well-structured company with clear commercial policies and a focus on customer service.
8636;8;I consider BASF an excellent company to work for. It offers the possibility of exchanging activities through the bib and particularly, I loved the maternity benefits, I spent six months taking care of my little one and today he is studying at an excellent school thanks to the daycare assistance.
8637;8;For the partnership and service above the ordinary. We have Basf as a partner and not just a supplier. This is a differential for the market.
8638;9;Although at times lacking in terms of delivery time, the company has good customer support. The team is always available when there is any difficulty with the products.
8639;9;We use Oxychlorination Catalyst VIII and whenever we need information or support we are well attended. We also receive technical visits where representatives present new products.
8640;8;Reliable and extremely competent company with its products
8641;8;It has good quality products, wide range in the portfolio.

8660;9;For the many years of partnership and commitment of BASF with its commercial partners.
8661;10;High level service, ease of dealing, negotiable prices.
8662;8;I was always attended promptly, even when it was urgent, that is, before the agreed lead time period.
8663;8;From the point of view of purchases, I have great, fast and efficient service.
8664;9;quality, agility and excellent service
8665;10;For the service provided.
8666;9;Excellent supplier !! However, there are always points to be improved.
8667;9;the material has excellent quality and technical assistance. Competitiveness is still an aspect that needs to improve.
8668;8;Engineering support and very good communication with the team.
8669;9;I would recommend Basf for its reliability and tradition in the market.
8670;9;because I work with the Suvinil brand and the quality of its products
8671;10;Products of indisputable quality, recognized by the consumer and loved by the painter
8672;8;competence, quality and commitment
8673;10;Quality and trust in products
8674;10;The Company has reliable principles.
8675;9;For being a reputable, responsible company and having high quality products.
8676;8;It would indicate that Basf is a serious company, has a clear commercial policy, quality products, is customer-oriented and transparent.
8677;9;An extremely reliable brand
8678;10;Why do I find an ethical and transparent company with excellent quality products
8679;10;The manufacturer is very concerned with quality and the painters prove it in practice.
8680;10;excellent company!
8681;8;"Great professionalism and seriousness on the part of the Basf team. Extremely team
 competent."
8682;9;Excellent service and feedback on demands.
8683;10;AN EXCELLENT COMPANY IN THE PAINT BUSINESS WHERE I HAVE CONTACT AND THAT WOULD INDICATE THE DEGREE OF QUALITY USED IN THE PRODUCTS, BUT STILL WITH HIGH VALUE IN RELATION TO OTHER PRODUCTS, SHOULD HAVE A MORE AGGRESSIVE FIGHTING PAINT!!
8684;9;Basf is a very partner company, is looking at customer needs individually and has a highly qualified team. However, because it is a multinational giant, it becomes slow to make some decisions and sometimes errs on the side of caution.
8685;8;Competent and highly professional company. She is always concerned about how to improve the Sell out and consequently improve the sell in. I believe together we can improve inventory management, avoid breakages and excesses.
8686;9;Excellent quality products.
8687;9;A credible company, partner and with a professional team.
8688;10;We have been working with the brand for years, in addition to knowing the product applied, we know the manufacturer's commitment to quality and practices of excellence!
8689;8;the brand is recognized among consumers and shoppers.
8690;8;A very serious company, it conveys confidence and quality in everything it does. Employees who are highly engaged and committed to the company they work for.
8691;10;It has a strong brand and quality products.
8692;9;This question has two sides, BASF products are very good, however, as I work directly with them, I see that the pricing policy among BASF customers is not satisfactory, as it is never complied with, always BASF itself on the part of ink is your biggest competitor.
8693;9;Ethical and responsible company
8694;9;Company with credibility and confidence in the market and its consumers. Always looking to advance and meet all demands in the best way.
8695;9;Despite some rough edges, the Basf concept of distribution is still satisfactory and promising, the commercial seriousness and focus on the market are of a high level, thus generating the distributor's satisfaction and commitment to being increasingly committed.
8696;10;"All because I believe in SUVINIL/BASF products for always presenting the best cost-benefit option, the products are above ABRAFAT's specifications.

 100% I recommend, we have the best solution in painting with the best product."
8697;9;For the certainty that they are quality and reliable products with great cost-benefit.
8698;8;I think Basf is a serious company, which works towards goals and objectives, and has a policy of transparency in its relationships.
8699;8;"I would recommend it because of the reason that Basf is a great company that prioritizes excellence in its activities: In the manufacture of high quality products, in serving customers and partners, in generating profitability for established businesses, in the search for constant evolution with a focus in sustainable development. Basf is a ""School"" for those who want to grow professionally and seek excellence in their career."
8700;10;"Proven quality products , could be top marks but sometimes the price
 is too high."
8701;10;Unquestionable quality of the Company's products and seriousness.
8702;10;Product quality, service excellence and innovation.

8730;9;For several reasons, among a few, working with raw materials, technology, labor, of excellent quality. Respect for the environment and its direct and indirect customers. For having earned the respect and added great recognition to the brand, and made the Suvinil name synonymous with paint.
8731;9;We work exclusively on Suvinil products.
8732;8;Serious company, with credibility, always seeking innovation, attentive to the market and its demands. Shows respect and ethics to the consumer, store owner and employees

8770;9;trustworthy company
8771;10;Reactivity and product variety
8772;8;Good service and relationship.
8773;9;Good service, quality material, still needs some adjustments regarding the speed of information and changes when necessary in the process.
8774;8;We have a long-standing relationship with BASF. The company has always served us with excellence, delivering a quality product at the right time. Over the years we have also noticed the company's proactivity in improving its operation, aiming to improve assistance to ADM. BASF also promptly responded to ADM's request for innovation and new synergies between the companies. With such a mature relationship, which generates benefits for both parties, I believe we still have a step forward in terms of pricing transparency.
8775;8;I consider a highly technically capable company with extremely reliable products and processes
8776;10;A lot of agility and knowledge of the technical area (Anderson Silva).
8777;8;good technical service
8778;9;Fast service, clear doubts and openness to negotiations.
8779;9;always on schedule, and has a good service channel.
8780;8;Punctuality in product delivery and product quality

8786;10;Customer service and sales always serving us in the best way, with respect to knowledge, readiness, problem solving
8787;9;Quality from the service to the final product!!!
8788;8;REcomedo 8, because today despite the very high quality I do not use many Basf products due to the price
8789;10;diversity of products and service
8790;10;quality, service, delivery time
8791;9;For already recommending regularly, in view of the quality of the products and trust in the brand.
8792;10;Because it is a brand that inspires confidence, has very high quality products, a qualified technical team (salespeople and technicians) and also provides prizes for both sellers and customers. That's why I always recommend Suvinil
8793;8;Service, product quality, delivery time.
8794;10;due to the service and punctuality.
8795;8;BASF is an excellent company to work in partnership. We have a quality product and a competent supplier.
8796;10;For being a German company and being in the top 3 in the market.
8797;9;Quality of service, team and portfolio
8798;9;Good products and good service
8799;10;Reputation of products with quality, tradition and seriousness in business.
8800;8;Product quality and service.
8801;10;Quality of products
8802;8;BASF has a fair commercial policy, it could have a better assessment if there were regular supply
8803;8;Excellence in product quality, contract fulfillment and support.
8804;8;For the splendid service provided by employees and for the quality of the product.
8805;8;punctuality, commitment to the client.
8806;10;It is a respected and recognized company in the market as the best manufacturer of chemical products in the world.
8807;9;Quality assured
8808;9;Good service in matters related to imports
8809;8;is a serious company committed to partnering with its customers.
8810;10;Good service, agility and quality.
8811;8;Quality product and good service.
8812;8;"Tract
 Punctuality
 Quality
 Reliability"
8813;9;Great service.
8814;6;Lack of products and delay in delivery
8815;7;uncompetitive pricing and product unavailability
8816;7;Unfortunately, I can't give a bigger name because of its sales pipeline. Distribution, in my point of view, doesn't work to open customers, it just takes advantage of the opportunities created by the stores served directly, and it still hurts us in the high-end price issue.
8817;6;good products
8818;5;"The difference in price between an exclusive customer who buys little and a multi-brand customer who has a high volume is very small.
 The discount should be more tied to volume than anything else, as it used to be.

 Lots of bureaucracy to solve technical problems.

 All sellout information is passed. Why are goals about purchases and not sales?

 In every survey, we asked for a modification to the Selfcolor system so that dosing errors are reduced. They need to place a barcode reader to identify if the base is correct for the color. And a field to indicate which salesperson dosed the paint."
8819;6;Basf is no longer an exclusive company with its partners, opening several distribution channels in the same area of activity, conflicting Basf with Basf. The brand was pulverized.
8820;6;THE PRODUCT IS GOOD, BUT THE PRICE IS NOT LEGAL... AND THE SAC... IS VERY BAD
8821;5;The price is still a little above the current one.
8822;6;Commercial policy between retailers and distributors is very similar.
8823;6;"Company with innovative solutions..
 Good technical features..."
8824;5;I think BASF leaves a lot to be desired, especially with its select partners.
8825;6;A big name company, but that has greatly reduced the quality of the product. Unfortunately!
8826;7;"BASF is recognized for its excellence in the quality of its products, but in terms of customer service or the account manager it leaves something to be desired with very long and ""stuck"" returns."
8827;7;"(+) Solid company.
 (+) Committed officials.
 (-) Very high prices and high commercial demands."
8828;7;SERIOUS PRODUCT AVAILABILITY AND PACKAGING QUALITY PROBLEMS
8829;7;They are products in which we could integrate them in integrated management
8830;7;Quality in its products
8831;7;We are a small client, and therefore the impersonality in the attention is quite noticeable.
8832;6;Based on all aspects of the business relationship. Products.Service.Delivery of merchandise.Information.Conditions of sale.
8833;5;Very good products, with development possibilities in the Argentine market but without continuity.
8834;7;The products are good. Sometimes things change without consulting and not having studied the implications well. In addition, being a large corporation commanded from another place, they make decisions that do not favor the Clients.
8835;6;Little flexibility and availability of items for not having the volumes of the mega companies
8836;7;"The qualification in this opportunity goes down, due to factors such as:

 1. Change of personnel in the support areas, which affect customer service. Confirmation of information, detailed monitoring and promptness in the required responses
 2. Missing material allocation
 3. Change in the agreed conditions, price and rebate"
8837;7;"Few raw materials available in the market
 Long delay in restocking"
8838;5;have the necessary knowledge
8839;7;"Because the prices of the chemicals that they offer to CHAIDE are well above the offer of various suppliers.
 The level of compliance with timely delivery of orders is low."
8840;7;In business year 2021, we had supply issues, I understand that all companies had. The shortest way to communicate was what was lacking.
8841;7;I feel that in my area, there are very few products that can be developed.
8842;5;They are excellent products, more field support should be given to the distributor's representatives
8843;6;They are having inventory problems
8844;6;Little product availability in key items, price increase up to 4 times in a year.
8845;6;They have good products but in the supply they have opportunities for improvement. Apparently they must improve their actions to be able to get the products on time for shipments.
8846;5;The availability of materials and prices are well above the competition. BASF seems to be the first to make price adjustments in the market and their product offering seems to be either very scarce or their pressure to make what they have profitable is very high, which has caused that basically there is no possibility of closing deals.
8847;5;They have good products, but their margins are unattractive and price wars between their distributors make the line unprofitable.
8848;6;Very good service. Constant delays in shipments and ship rollovers have been a major challenge for BASF.
8849;5;"I only know Basf, as a Credenz customer. Regarding the agrochemical portfolio, I only know it from a theoretical point of view, and I approve, but I have never had practical experience as a Basf distributor.
 From an operational point of view with Credenz, our level of satisfaction is a 10."
8850;5;Above average price.
8851;6;"The portfolio very little
 Lack of product diversity"
8852;5;lost agility
8853;5;BASF offers a very interesting product palette, and provides samples for evaluation and technical assistance as needed, but has been experiencing frequent delays and rescheduling in fulfilling purchase orders.
8854;6;They are not easily accessible for contact and for possible negotiations and that may occur.
8855;6;Not very likely due to the cost of the product and the products are not always 100% available.
8856;6;The products have acceptable quality, however we have had some problems with the supply times.
8857;5;BASF is being heavily impacted by several force majeure events and raw material restrictions in the market. This brought us a lot of insecurity in terms of supply, as well as price increase announcements for 2022
8858;7;Because of BASF's relevance to our business and BASF's business, our partnership should be stronger. I think the MKT actions that BASF carries out in our region are of little relevance, all very complex without a vision of commercial partnership. The products come imposed without prior work with the network of influencers and recommenders.
8859;5;Basf's portfolio has some products inferior to other companies, and even so there is an insistence on the sale, impacting on rebate payments. Regarding rebate, it's a lot of rule, being difficult to interpret
8860;6;Good Products.
8861;7;"would not recommend to a fellow dealership as there is an overlap of BASF dealers in the region.
 would mend for the quality of the products and for the research part."
8862;6;Excellent products, but a difficult company to negotiate and not so trustworthy.
8863;6;Good portfolio and good quality of products.
8864;6;I believe there is considerable room for improvement in understanding customer needs. Many unnecessary conflicts and lack of a strategy where the real competitor is the other manufacturers.
8865;7;Trade policy on redistribution with very low margins due to price war.
8866;7;An important partner of the Group, but at the time of support and support regarding costs in the pandemic, it was not flexible, we always had to adapt to its points. We were concerned about how the loss of business due to this seemed to have no importance.
8867;7;Difficulty in the negotiation process, delivery x return.
8868;6;There are 2 things to differentiate, the first is Basf, with which in these 22 years I have had a very good business relationship and I would rate it a 10, but the second is Glasurit, which in these last 2 years I have felt a distance, a lack of support.
8869;6;Very innovative company, with a well-implemented ESG culture, but with much more expensive ingredients than market competitors, even in commoditized segments.
8870;5;It is a serious and responsible company
8871;7;"Positive: Quality products and an excellent line of research.

 Negative: Credibility of information and constant product shortages"
8872;5;Price
8873;6;I still had little contact with the brand, but as far as I could monitor and make contacts with BASF's technical assistance, I was very well attended.
8874;5;Many distributors in the same area selling the same product. This takes the focus off the quality of the product and the technical assistance provided and starts to direct the focus only to those who have the lowest price.
8875;5;"I even improved the score compared to the
 previous."
8876;7;When talking about CX, an important part of this is the company's culture to put the Customer at the Center of the Process (Customer Centric)... Understand the pain, put the customer's shoes on, participate and support the customer's growth. We perceive at BASF the pro-product culture (Product Centric), still far from what can make the client a Promoter ..... I say this from my client perspective (not generalizing).
8877;7;Selling product and no delivery, canceled our finale, heat, and delayed delivery of orkestra and ativum. Not to mention that we realized that Coamo was privileged, for it there was no shortage of product, it is selling even for the next harvest and at a price below cost and we have to keep begging to invoice, so I would not recommend BASF... as for product quality, we have nothing to comment
8878;7;"We have a great relationship and a supply that works well in the Metabisulfite line, however for some product lines such as Cetyl Oil and DMAPA Alcohols we have had many problems with BASF's supply.
 Service of these two product lines has been very flawed and the answers are not satisfactory."
8879;5;Disorganization
8880;7;They don't have many products.
8881;5;"There is a difficulty in providing quick service at Basf Brasil - our branch is cellulose and we noticed a long delay in the transfer of logistics information.
 We buy an imported product from Basf Germany called Pluriol and the transfer of information is always very slow."
8882;5;BASF has great products, excellent quality, but the point of improvement would be the service part.
8883;6;we need more products to serve our customer.
8884;6;We are still having problems receiving agreed values in 20/21 harvest campaigns.... Combo Basf... unfortunately
8885;7;I have no reason to
8886;6;It takes a little more flexibility
8887;6;Beyond the quality of the products, the cost is somewhat high for the time of so much competition that we are going through,

 High financial demands"
8890;5;I am Brazilian and the vision I had of BASF was always good, of excellence, until 2019 I began to work in painting at the Malvinas plant in Argentina. We had many technical problems and from BASF we did not have satisfactory answers. For several times we penalized our process with changes in parameters, trajectory, rework in pieces due to lack of paint stability, degradation and other problems that until today they could not explain to us. Nor did they demonstrate knowing how to use troubleshooting support tools such as 8D, for example. As for the BASF group, for now I still have a good image, but the same is not the case with BASF Argentina.
8891;7;Very good portfolio, with a good commercial work team, however with slow and unclear processes, and more investment of the portfolio work in the field is necessary.
8892;7;Because, in general, it has products suited to the needs of customers.
8893;5;It has a good range of products, it has been positioning itself in our region. More commercial feed back between distributor and company policies is missing. Seek + win win.
8894;5;Very innovative, competitive prices, very good quality but internal processes are very rigid and delayed (ability to respond to advances, responses to rejections, etc.)
8895;6;Unethical and pass the information of the agreements with large farmers to other distributors
8896;7;"WE RECEIVE SUPPORT AS AN INDENPENDENT CUSTOMER
 GOOD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
 GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE"
8897;5;The paint is great, but the delivery has been horrible. in addition to the product being damaged, many banknotes are missing material.
8898;6;Dealing with financial services, it is a team that makes an efficient and agile service.
8899;7;Well the offices need to refine the technical area
8900;6;Delay in product delivery!
8901;6;The product is of quality, but the technical support for problem resolution leaves a lot to be desired, especially in the delay in response.
8902;7;We think that Suvinil has been losing a lot of space with regard to support and partner along with resellers!
8903;6;"Great products.
 Doubtful strategy for maintaining partners and customers."
8904;7;Unquestionable quality, but inflexibility in negotiations interferes with new business, high prices compared to competitors
8905;5;We recommend BASF for the performance
8906;6;"Good product portfolio; recognized brand; on the one hand and on the other, high price dispersion of its products at the level of distribution channels."
8907;6;Recently, we had a big surprise with BASF's attitude towards canceling orders and delaying the delivery of products, causing us discomfort with clients and company Directors, leaving the sales team in a delicate situation.
8908;5;Excessive delay in the response of Basf Argentina and Basf Brazil
8909;7;Stable product in terms of quality. Price completely unfavorable for the market.
8910;5;Due to not having delivered the volume of FINALE closed in the 21/22 campaign, causing a lot of inconvenience and damage to the cooperative.
8911;5;very expensive prices
8912;6;some items are not available for immediate delivery, requiring import within 60 to 90 days, and for continued marketing, it is necessary to place firm orders, which is currently relatively difficult due to market fluctuations.
8913;5;Good and reliable business partner
8914;6;"Although BASF has one of the largest product portfolios, it ends up failing a lot in terms of communication, especially in critical times like the one we are experiencing.
 Perhaps this is due to the size of the company, but it is a persistent failure."
8915;7;either my shopkeeper or customer opinion. as a shopkeeper I give 0 because there is already a lot in my region and the prices are already very low. some moment smaller than cmv
8916;6;"My grade is based on the lack of shares and low profitability that I, a select client, am going through.
 I have a great example this year. With the consequent table increases, since June until now I have been paying for Suvinil's spaghetti the same amount that is being sold in the market, I have already sent several quotations, home center prints, budgets from non-select clients and clients of distribution, where they can sell the product at the price I'm buying. The answer is always the same, they will increase, but how does someone manage to sell a product for so long for the same purchase price and it's not just spaghetti, we have classic, enamel, etc..
 This makes the margin of the Suvinil brand practically unsustainable for a Select customer that fulfills its objective agreement on a monthly basis.
 Including the profitability. some items at the suggested price by suvinil itself, the margin is well below 30%. I ask, can anyone work with products (several products) with a margin below 30%? Today for science I need a margin of at least 36%.
 I compete face to face with large stores that have a well-considered differential in terms of purchase price and much smaller stores, managed by the owners and family members, with a very similar cost price. See how my scenario is and I don't see any action to improve. In other words, in the commercial policy that I have been following, you are a large retailer or you have to be a micro retailer. We also have the issue of distribution, which sells products cheaper than the factory. Do not be unworthy, this is a fact and proven.
 Anyway, I've been a Suvinil partner for over 15 years, I work the whole line and defend the brand, but unfortunately and based on what I said above among other things, lately our partnership is very unilateral.
 Big hug, good business and I hope that together we can improve this, PARTNERSHIP."
8917;5;DOES NOT HONOR CLOSED ORDERS.
8918;6;"- Internal strategy to deal with DAS and Resellers reflected in the field. We lost a lot of customers to Akzo. Customers cannot get competitive prices to fight with a large dealer in the region that has aggressive PMA. And DAS is no longer able to squeeze the margin on products.

 - Weak marketing. Budget directed to DAS marketing is insufficient. Lack of merchandising materials. Presence in irrelevant media."
8919;7;I could rate it even higher, but lately I'm dissatisfied with the service provided by the BASF team.
8920;7;GOOD SERVICE
8921;6;Prices are high.
8922;6;"Confused pricing policy
 Can't control the market price
 Pricing policy, distribution better than that of customers"
8923;7;The brand is strong in the market, the professionals are qualified and the company conveys security in the agreements. The downside is the lack of more involved action in controlling the peak price.
8924;7;"1. Fixed commercial policies, prioritizing volume in large customers instead of margin, generating a generalized mess in the market.
 2. Product margins are increasingly smaller, making the business less profitable in the face of changes in the market and extra costs that the storekeeper has, such as: equipment maintenance, loss of paint, damage, etc.
 3. Unfair competition, without preserving the area of activity of ELO/SELECT partner stores.
 4. Low investment in POS and commercial actions. There is a lack of creativity in new actions to bring flow to the physical store."
8925;5;Great portfolio. Serious professionals. Serious company. / However, the product delivery schedule is dire, it always arrives late in relation to use. We do not sell Basf products out of stock, which suppresses sales. It's been repeated for years, it's not just this year's 20/21 problem. They force the delivery of products that you don't need, newly launched products, with faulty diffusion, that is, the product takes a long time to hit the market.
8926;7;Hello, the products are of excellent quality, but bad logistics, and other failures in service in general.
8927;6;Low product availability, commercial condition misaligned with the market, little proactivity, not proposing business in advance or taking advantage of opportunities.
8928;6;insufficient portfolio for HF, lack of insecticides in the line and selective herbicides for HF
8929;5;"Uncertainty in receiving products.
 - They are not delivering part of what was negotiated/bought
 - Delay in deliveries"
8930;7;Very high quality product
8931;7;Complete absence of technical support with qualified people to solve technical problems that arise. Service period of up to 30 days, with no return or priority for this type of service, especially for exclusive customers of the brand. There is clear evidence that the commercial and technical areas do not speak and cannot effectively solve the problem as soon as possible. We didn't work for 4 days of the tintometric equipment and only got feedback after several complaints and management involvement. We are very unhappy with the recent event. We are charged and we are required to comply with rules and we do not have any counterpart in a priority and functional service
8932;7;Please let us know the reason for your grade.
8933;6;"The quality of the products is unquestionable.
 Basf suffers from the lack of professionals in the field, high turnover, scarcity of products and non-compliance with the portfolios built with the client (in this case cooperative).

 abs."
8934;7;We are building our partnership and we strongly believe that with the commercial team that was renewed, we will be able to have better after-sales results.
8935;7;They have lost credibility due to defaults in dispatches and in quotes
8936;7;They have lead times that are too long, which means they do not have a secure supply
8937;7;The response times to all the queries without exception are very delayed, and we have to be asking many times until they finally answer
8938;6;For his pursuit of innovation.
8939;6;Because of the reliability of the chemicals and technical support (Oscar Volpini)
8940;6;High quality and efficient products, but poor customer service.
8941;5;Until the month of June we would have given it a 10 but for reasons of the company not of who manages us we lowered it to 7
8942;6;I would recommend it for the technical advice and quality. However in the industry I work (tannery) I don't see much participation from BASF
8943;7;is a brand recognized by the workshop owner, innovation characterizes them both in colorimetry and in products
8944;7;IT IS A VERY GOOD COMPANY BUT TODAY IT HAS PRE-PIPELINE AVAILABILITY PROBLEMS.
8945;5;BASF does not honor the commercial terms of the agreements.
8946;6;CUSTOMER SERVICE
8947;5;BASF has products of excellent quality, however it has little capacity to respond and to anticipate logistical problems (pandemic) or quality observations (example: packaging problems that are only detected when the material arrives and is individually reviewed).
8948;7;In recent times, BASF has looked more at its business than the strategic relationship with its customer. Although it has not stopped supplying us, as the paint business was more profitable for it, it marginalized the latex for paper business and therefore breached the consignment agreements at the plant, putting our production at risk. For this reason lower your score to 7 points.
8949;5;For the recent decisions in its trade policy.
8950;6;Failure to supply raw materials.
8951;6;Very good products, but with important problems in Logistics
8952;6;Sometimes they do not have product availability, and the responses are not so fast
8953;6;Good attention and service
8954;6;"It only has specific materials; and the conditions offered in general are not necessarily the best on the market."
8955;5;They have quality materials.
8956;7;"Good morning, I'm rating this survey 5 because I don't understand the question.

 When you refer to what extent would you recommend it, from what point of view is the question:

 From a technical point of view, the quality of its products as a technical response in the field.
 From the point of view of Business, that is to say how the experience of working with BASF as a supplier of products has been.

 From the point of view of service, how has the customer service or customer experience been for us based on what we have shared.

 If you help me with this clarification, I would be happy to give you my comments and feedback.

 Greetings,"
8957;7;It is understood that due to the current situation, and all the new limitations, the supply, price and shipment of products have been affected, but perhaps there are measures that could be adopted to reduce the impact.
8958;7;The quality of the products is not in doubt, but currently the availability is doubtful and uncertain. In addition, when closing a business, it is not invoiced and therefore the exchange rate runs even when we decide to pesify
8959;5;They have very good quality but they take a long time in technical answers and it is not clear at times who it should be addressed to, they are very large and we do not have an account manager only for the company but many depending on the business segment.
8960;6;High reliability products, good service performance (quality / logistics), but high prices.
8961;7;I understand that Suvinil has a vast mix of products and solutions for its target audience, but every day it becomes more distant from the reality of many obtaining a suvinil product, due to the constant increase in its high-end prices, in view of the large offer of products with similar performances!
8962;5;Difficult to solve some problems.
8963;7;Lack of product.
8964;7;It's been a long time since I made the last purchase, however, I remember that we had a delay in the information about the ship's booking (10 days), since we were urgent in receiving the cargo.
8965;7;I think the service and proximity to customers should be improved.
8966;6;Only for the price they are equal to distributors in Brazil. Little price difference.
8967;7;There is a lot of lack of a customer relationship with the sales force
8968;5;"I need to improve the relationship and return program for the distributor and sales force.
 Be simpler and easier to understand."
8969;7;Material technology, service. Factory in Brazil of polymers.
8970;7;Company is not a partner of the customer
8971;6;I really like the work of BASF and also the diversity in the portfolio with various types of materials to offer, but it is worth remembering that in the recent past we had a serious crisis in relation to the supply of material produced by the local BASF and this generated great internal stress for Unilever, apart from the super on cost that we didn't expect, it was very disappointing, so I can't rate it higher either
8972;7;We have been working with BASF for over 20 years, which has remained serious about prices and supply even during the pandemic period.
8973;7;lack of service
8974;6;LACK OF MERCHANDISE
8975;5;We have received little support for the development of their products, a lot of invasion of zones and low profitability in the business
8976;6;IN THE LAST TIME THEY HAVE NOT COMPLIED WITH PORTLAND'S NEEDS IN RELATION TO DOCUMENTATION AND SHIPPING DATES
8977;6;Quality products with high customer reliability. Does not give higher marks due to failures and delays in service.
8978;5;The recommendation is relative since Basf being such a large company is sometimes more complicated for medium-sized clients.
8979;6;"The constant lack of products, especially from the A curve, as we are exclusive, this constant lack of products has harmed us a lot, we are losing a lot of sales.
 Not to mention the lack of partnership to promote the brand within the point of sale, e.g. Uniforms, store rug, Tax coupon, Bag, inflatables, adhesives for delivery vehicles, etc.... At the same time, we are very Well serviced by our consultant Carol, who has done everything to minimize the logistical problem that has persisted since 2018."
8980;5;Information does not flow as if we were working as partners. More closeness, technical-commercial support is lacking.
8981;7;"Good quality of products, good information, reliable.
 Improve supply in place and shorten delivery times"
8982;5;For trust in the company.
8983;6;the leading brands in the market have many distribution channels, so high-end prices are very difficult to be controlled, the big industries at the moment are having bigger problems with delivery than the smaller ones, even because of their larger market share, even understanding this, it causes a very big inconvenience for us who prioritize selling branded products
8984;5;"The partnership with Suvinil is very complicated.
 You are not able to establish market prices and it is becoming impossible to sell the brand.
 The other retailers (Elevato, Sul Cores, Aquarela and Thony) are selling at prices up to two increases back and we are having to convert our sales into other brands to be able to sell with a healthy margin.
 In addition to pulling the market down, we also get a reputation for paying customers."
8985;5;Basf works with excellent quality products, but for some sectors it does not take into account the partnership with the customer, for example, we had cases of orders closed with BASF and already with acceptance of supply and upon delivery, BASF simply informed the decline service, without giving the customer a chance to study together a solution to the problem. Another sector that we deal with with BASF asks us to place our orders, but they do not guarantee service, which in our understanding does not bring any guarantee of supply and exposes us to a very high risk of shortages.
8986;7;The lack of products in the Basf portfolio gives reason not to widely recommend the brand.
8987;6;Company with excellent technical capability
8988;5;lack of deliveries
8989;7;"Grade 10 = Brand credibility / Consultant Service

 I didn't get 10 due to logistics and shipping failures.."
8990;5;"You cannot argue with the quality and that they are creators of chemistry, with affordable prices.

 Only in my opinion they should improve what is in the logistics environment.
 Greetings and grateful for your collaboration and I am at your disposal for whatever you need.
 Angel"
8991;7;Good quality of the products and good sales service, but many problems to deliver in recent months (just like the whole market by the way). This caused us to lose customers and a lot of pre-sales work. We almost have to start over with the brand.
8992;6;The attention of the account is good, the products also, payment term 60 should go to 75 days
8993;6;UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS
8994;6;We are having many problems with the fulfillment of the delivery dates and the functionality of the RA 288 product (Consult our quality department)
8995;6;Lack of local stock for products that are not within the planning.
8996;5;Although the quality and performance of the products purchased is excellent, given the current situation, an opportunity for improvement is identified at the logistics level and in response times in general. Improving flexibility in processes is also key as an adaptive change in the face of today's challenges, implementing effective and immediate action plans in order to improve various aspects such as coverage inventories, reserves and booking for imports, etc. taking advantage of the robustness of a company like BASF. In the same way, the timely and detailed communications on alerts and the work on the identification of risks in advance could be improved taking into account the scope and the possible tools that BASF could have to access said information. As BELCORP we recognize the effort made by all the teams within basg throughout the year to provide support in the face of new developments and guarantee timely supply.
8997;7;"Product quality is very good
 It is recognized worldwide
 But the quality of customer care and service in Peru is very limited due to the following:
 - Deficiency in the availability of products that involve product kits (varnish, catalyst and solvent)
 - Delays in international imports that greatly affect the stock break
 - Lack of availability of color tools for customer service (catalogs, color guide, shades of gray, among others
 - Lack of attention and advice in physical or virtual presence"
8998;6;"the prices in general are reasonable, the attention is good although there is a lack of more details regarding the shipment scheduling. We need information on the probable date of shipment and BASF insists on informing the estimated arrival date, finally it ends up embarking on the date of our need at destination.
 What the shipping lines estimate less and less conforms to reality."
8999;5;They are a serious company that can be more competitive in prices and services.
9000;7;Quality product
9001;7;They must internally evaluate the quality of services
9002;6;"First of all, we continue to have delays in the delivery of orders, we understand that worldwide there are complications of ship availability, container availability, etc. But we feel that BASF or its logistics operator does not fully control the operation.
 On the other hand, with regard to the supply of chemicals, we have been forced to look for other suppliers because BASF does not have chemical availability, as is the case with Polyol Convecional; o The prices of its chemicals have a difference of more than 10% with the existing supply worldwide. The message we get from BASF is that they can't do anything with prices, this causes us to buy more products from other Asian suppliers."
9003;7;"Because I have been working with basf for 2 years and I don't have a contract.
 The prices are not competitive for brands in the same category and the gross margin is not extremely low for other businesses that I have. When I started, they told me about margins that are actually the lower half.
 The charge d'affaires of my country does not answer emails or calls and does not do what he promises to do."
9004;6;Excellent quality and attention
9005;7;It depends on the origin it leaves, we have many problems with foreign trade.
9006;6;They offer good products, but they are not agile in the supply.
9007;7;Good service and quality of products
9008;5;proximity
9009;7;Delay in deliveries and lack of material availability.
9010;6;The portfolio with little solution to our problems
9011;6;Sometimes, we take a long time to get feedback on the question asked. I know that we often depend on responses from other countries, but it is worth sending even a line to the customer, stating that the matter is being addressed.
9012;5;"Sandra's support has been excellent, I have no doubt that she has always made the maximum effort to provide us with the information in a timely manner.
 The qualification has to do with the low availability of raw materials that are normally used such as Basorol 9954A, IDCAP and Basoplur P4000 for Ecuador."
9013;5;I consider it to have good products, very good technical support but very low commercial flexibility
9014;5;the products are good, but the costs are high
9015;6;We have had late deliveries.
9016;5;Product quality, ....
9017;7;The commercial attention and the product are of excellence. Year-over-year availability continues to have issues.
9018;6;Reliable company in quality
9019;7;The main reason is to combine order schedules and values and not to honor later and change the commercial condition, this does not generate credibility, we understand that if we have an approved and agreed PO, they must be complied with.
9020;5;Many dealers authorized by BASF in the same city, apart from products that come from abroad. That BASF does not shy away from this.
9021;7;FOR THE BROAD PORTFOLIO, EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT.
9022;7;In short, there would be an excessive lack of merchandise since before the pandemic and also excess bureaucracy in some processes.
9023;7;"Crop - excellent products, but serious problems in distribution, not to mention that we have been without a manager for a long time. We have a feeling that we are in the background for Basf.
 TSI - products losing performance, but with a very good policy and a very competent area manager (pedro lara)"
9024;7;Technical misalignment between RTV BASF and the Cooperative's Technical Coordination.
9025;7;BASF has a great product portfolio and we are very interested in increasing our partnership with you, but we have not been able to do business directly with you in some segments due to your policy of selling through distributors. We have also noticed that the prices currently offered to GRUPO LIMPPANO do not take into account our potential and growth.
9026;5;If you are a consumer friend, I would give 10, if you are a friend interested in becoming a storekeeper, I would give 2. I am select, I have pending orders with basf for 8 months, products of the curve A type acrylic matte, light touch, nail polish for more than 60 days , for those who only work with one brand, this is terrible. Our bongo van always circulated around the city with the Suvinil brand, this time the adhesive was denied.
9027;7;"Greater clarity in the discount policy.
 Too much breakage of curve A products.
 SERIOUS problem of commercial policy of Distribuidora Progresso, practicing prices of final consumer for tenants."
9028;7;It wasn't bigger because the points program is very complicated and bad
9029;6;PRICES ABOVE THE COMPETITION
9030;7;"The quality of the products is indisputable; however, availability and costs are very high and the time taken to obtain samples or fulfill orders in recent months has imposed a series of difficulties on the business."
9031;6;Logistics structure leaves something to be desired
9032;5;many plant problems, delay in delivery ....
9033;7;Exclusive supplier, has served us well, but there is always room for improvement.
9034;7;The problem is that as Basf works with a wide range of products, it is often difficult to find out who are the people responsible for certain products. So my grade is 6 because it would be restricted to the two products I've already imported, and I wouldn't know who to recommend.
9035;5;Good Morning . I know we are going through difficult times , and the market is increasingly competitive , but forgetting about small and old customers is a kind of weird policy ........ So ..... this is my grade .
9036;6;"As an end customer, yes, as it has a consistent portfolio for our target cultures.
 As a reseller, it needs to improve, as we have several problems of consistency in pricing and sometimes there is a feeling of distance from our company.
 Good job of generating demand in the field."
9037;6;Distancing
9038;7;Today, with Basf present in a very strong way in the cooperatives, they have been causing a reflection in the distributor, about their future with it
9039;7;Harvest Price Policy 21-22 have not arrived until and would have needed to arrive weeks ago. This type of situation is very detrimental to the planning of our company. The market demands us more and more in advance and not the other way around ...
9040;5;If this question had been asked me a year ago my grade would be a 10, today we are abandoned, little concern for our area
9041;6;I recommend
9042;6;It remains to define a better commercial strategy and link the technical and local team with the market and its realities for more concrete and practical support actions
9043;7;They are getting very complicated to negotiate
9044;5;good products ........ but product information is little available
9045;6;Deliveries are a bit
9046;6;The quality is indisputable, maybe that's why I could recommend it with a 10, but there are very few business opportunities. Maybe that's why I put a 7
9047;7;From the place of the Basf distributor or dealer. We would like to have more support in actions related to how to grow within the area. More accompaniment in POG. Access to targeted / specific training.
9048;6;LACK OF SUPPORT TO THE DISTRIBUTOR IN DEMAND GENERATION, PRODUCT WITH NEXT EXPIRATION DATES, DELAY IN LEGALIZATION OF PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS (INCONFORM CUSTOMERS).
9049;5;I think it is an acceptable average, since they have good proven products, the only thing that is competing with other companies that give them away, that goes to the detriment of being recommended over other chemicals, in order to compete on price and not quality
9050;6;Considering that BASF has an excellent palette of products, the prices that come out to the market do not favor the generation of demand. Being the distributors who burst the prices who close the deals.
9051;7;More presence of BASF is needed to monitor its products in the field.
9052;6;I am a distributor and sometimes the areas and prices are not entirely clear
9053;7;Good morning, for years our Company has faithfully adopted you as exclusive Suppliers of Styrofan RX411 latex and in a matter of days they communicated to us the decision of BASF to drastically reduce the amount of material to be produced and to deliver us monthly, even by changing the item in question despite having them asked for a reasonable period of time to have the chance to reorganize and not nearly as happens today, having us paralyze the production of our Industrial Plant. Yes, I highlight the professionalism and goodwill of the Czarnitzki Technical Salesperson who, within his possibilities, has tried to comply with us.
9054;7;The recommendation would be for the palette of products, mainly herbicides. in the case of insecticides, having a limited palette, I would not recommend it
9055;6;In the last time they have delayed deliveries and have delivered products out of specification.
9056;5;"First of all, I want to clarify that I am aware of the context that we are experiencing at the country and global level, I am patient in terms of claims and in solidarity to seek joint solutions. That said, I want to let you know my disagreement with situations that have occurred in the last time:
 - Delays, in excessive cases, in the delivery of the merchandise.
 - Rustic and tedious processes for the times we live in (orders, payments, investments).
 - Missing merchandise.
 - After-sales, I think we have to find a new approach to assist the workshop, the shirt became obsolete, another type of collaboration is required in my opinion.

 Despite my age, I have known the business for more than 20 years and Glasurit for almost the same time, I feel completely identified with the brand, however, today I believe that we do not follow the speed of change typical of modernity. If I can be useful in something I am at your disposal to collaborate.

 Say hello atte.

 Nicolás Amezcua."
9057;7;"Company with high quality standards, sustainable business relationship in the long term,
 wide, innovative and growing product palette."
9058;5;"In general, they have a good service, however, situations have happened to us that hinder the commercial relationship. For example...
 Once I contacted the customer service whatsapp and they asked me to only speak to the mail.
 On the other hand, although we have an agreed purchase condition, they always issue us debit notes for exchange differences.
 Another aspect is that it is very bureaucratic to get information from BASF. For example, on one occasion they issued a wrong debit note and we had to contact several people to get answers.
 Lastly, there was a period of time in which the person in charge of attending us was on vacation and during that time they misplaced 2 of our orders, which led to a very important lack of raw material."
9059;5;Good service and response to technical inquiries.
9060;5;They are excellent suppliers, but it is very cumbersome to find the exact person for the required product and many times I resort to another option because I do not have an answer.
9061;6;delivery instability
9062;7;Due to the extremely long deliveries and the great lack of product.
9063;6;The issue of Agross greatly hinders any claim to growth and reliability at Basf on the part of any distributor.
9064;6;For the quality of the material, I would certainly recommend it. By not meeting the agreed deadlines in orders scheduled too far in advance, BASF loses credibility.
9065;7;We are satisfied with Basf products. The Brand is strong in our region, having great credibility in the market and a high perceived quality, however in the last year we had many problems related to the company's logistics. Basf had many difficulties in delivering the products. We suffer from constant shortages, consequently with lost sales. These losses are aggravated precisely because we have an exclusivity contract with BASF. If BASF doesn't deliver, we don't have a choice for the customer, so we lose out to the competition.
9066;5;BASF is an excellent company, with excellent products and reliability. However, the finish areas being passed on to distributors lose quality in service and logistics, in addition to having the highest product values in relation to the competition.
9067;5;Stable product, but BASF is difficult in terms of logistics and risk mitigation in the production chain
9068;6;Company with a good portfolio of pesticides, but with accentuated price dispersion.
9069;7;"BASF has good technological solutions, but its pricing policy is predatory. The way it treats prices makes the ""price war"" to lower prices and not to keep and raise them."
9070;5;Great portfolio but commercial difficulties and product delivery delays
9071;6;IN THIS NEW STAGE OF NEGOTIATIONS, THE DISTRIBUTORS ARE LEFT OUT OF BUSINESS, SINCE IT IS NO LONGER ATTRACTIVE FOR MY COMPANY TO MARKET BASF PRODUCTS, UNTIL THE PREVIOUS CYCLE, EVERYTHING WAS GOOD BUT THIS YEAR I DON'T THINK I WILL BE ABLE TO REACH THE GOALS AND MEET THE GOALS THAT THERE ARE OTHER COMPANIES THAT TAKE US MORE SERIOUSLY AS BUSINESS PARTNERS, WHERE WE CAN COME TO AGREEMENTS, AND HERE IT IS DOING THE OPPOSITE ONLY IMPOSITIONS BY BASF WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OUR WORK OR COMMENTS.
9072;6;I think that Basf at certain times has prices far above the market, compared to its main competitors
9073;5;"great product, great market acceptance, great cost benefit, price practiced by the market and manufacture does nothing zero.

 there are shopkeepers selling for years without paying operating costs and there is nothing to stop the factory."
9074;7;Good quality product and good technical assistance
9075;6;Just one of the brands we work on...
9076;6;Several
9077;5;UNFAIR COMPETITION IN THE MARKET, BASF HAS NO CONTROL OF GENERIC DYES USED IN THE MARKET WHICH CAUSES A VERY BIG PRICE DIFFERENCE FOR THOSE WORKING WITH ORIGINAL.
9078;7;Although they are good products, they do not generate profitability for the business.
9079;7;Basf's incentive program for sales and rebiting for cooperatives is not very aggressive. Good products and good access policies.
9080;5;Good company, portfolio leaves something to be desired
9081;7;Good service, however the company is very plastered in relation to requests (payment term for example).
9082;5;"Exclusive delivery policy.
 Despite repeated requests, we are not met.
 We have already passed and we are going through difficult times as an exclusivity not to be supplied."
9083;6;"Strengths
 * Products with good performance;
 * Portfolio that meets the needs of the resale and producers;
 * Sales team with good knowledge about the products.

 Negative points
 * They would need to be more effective in solving problems that occur with products in their portfolio at the producer."
9084;7;As an agro-inputs marketer, the profitability of this line has been reduced by the price war caused by such open distribution and very low suggested minimum prices.
9085;7;Excellent quality products, however, little flexibility to meet the needs of small customers.
9086;5;Committed and ethical company
9087;7;Different conditions are being applied in channels here in Rio Grande do Sul-in this specific case the conditions are totally different which caused big problems in the market- in our specific case in Tupanciretã we lost 50% of customers and automatically of billings- this channel is the 3 goals that he now runs within Basf and buys the market at prices below the cost of other distributors
9088;6;"I only miss ten because I lack agility.
 and I do not agree with commercial policy to be very similar to BAYER.
 With good products what should be done and simplify policies and be collective
 ."
9089;6;Very good commercial team and gives me all the necessary support, but we have already faced difficulties with the technical team in the past.
9090;6;"BASF's Commercial Imposition at the end of 2019 was a true CHAOS, significantly impacting the relationship we had between customer x supplier.

 Today I look at this relationship more clearly, but we still have a ""foot"" behind BASF"
9091;7;SOME INSTABILITIES IN RECOMMENDING THE PRODUCTS.
9092;6;Commercial stance resulted in the breaking of a relationship of more than 30 years.
9093;7;There is currently a shortage of material on the market, affecting our operation
9094;6;A supplier that demonstrates credibility.
9095;5;"Product quality is not the same. Lack of merchandise, expensive price. Unfair competition in the same Suvinil shopkeeper. Change of Management almost every year, this greatly affects the development of the region with the brand.
 But the main problem is the unfair competition with the same brand, this is forcing me to place other brands within our group of stores."
9096;7;I would recommend it with reservations as I am dissatisfied with a recurring undue commercial posture of the company.
9097;5;I have a close relationship with Basf that has now exceeded 48 years. Last year, at the beginning of the pandemic, we at Palmeira Tintas made many commitments to Basf and with the intention of maintaining our numbers with the company. Unfortunately, we were unable to honor all commitments within the agreed deadline. Aid was offered and the outstanding balance was financed, with financial cost, until June this year. We had the promise that they would gradually restore our credit according to the payments. However, since last year we were only allowed to buy in cash (with 5 days and a credit limit of R $ 10,000 per store), causing us difficulty in working with the brand, causing the stores to run out of Suvinil. We find this attitude inelegant because we have always been recognized in the market as examples of a Basf customer and the lack of credit has caused us great embarrassment. We were forced to appeal to other suppliers to ensure the stores' survival. Even though we are a customer with a potential of one million liters, we believe that we have not been treated correctly by the company's financial sector. I am hurt and so are my employees because we are passionate about Suvinil. I thought that the treatment given to the subject was very cold and disproportionate to my history and everything I did for the brand. Fernando Palmeira.
9098;5;We recently had a very significant loss due to non-compliance with the contracted tonnage of hydrosulfite.
9099;5;Nowadays, it is very difficult regarding technical information about delay or unavailability or alternatives of MP Basf.
9100;6;We are in a strategic alliance process to achieve competitive advantages.
9101;6;I recommend it for its quality, but the cost is very high.
9102;7;Is what I consider
9103;5;good quality
9104;6;Quality products, but with poor delivery timeliness.
9105;5;Portfolio of products in my area, quite complete.
9106;5;really the service is not good!
9107;7;Because planning is not in Chile, the response time is very long, many times, the requirements or queries are lost
9108;7;BASF is a provider that strives to deliver a good service to its customers, they care about following up on cases and having information on time.
9109;5;Good quality of merchandise, very high prices.
9110;6;lack of stocks and delay in deliveries
9111;7;The attention from the seller is excellent, but from the management there is no contact with the needs of the company you need and it is different in each area.-
9112;5;"VERY GOOD PRODUCTS
 LOW DEVELOPMENT AND LOW GENERATION OF BUSINESSES IN THE AREA
 UNINTENDABLE AND NON-AGREED OBJECTIVE PLANS, NOT ADEQUATE
 POOR CLARITY PRICE LIST AND PRICE AND COMMERCIAL POLICY IN THE AREA
 INFLEXIBILITY, LITTLE LISTENING TO CUSTOMER NEEDS"
9113;6;Good products, but stiff service
9114;6;We have not received a satisfactory response from the ED Dispersiones Acrilicas business after several emails and phone calls regarding the S 702 and S 400 seriously affecting production, we had to quickly go out to find competitive products and approve them in a short time since the answer was without certainties.
9115;5;It is a supplier with excellent products, however its commercial strength is limited for Colombia, its logistics are slow, and they leave and enter the market very intermittently.
9116;5;Lack of presence in the area and permanent support to farmers, this generates trust between the supplier and us, the brand is not everything, it requires monitoring of applications and support to our customers
9117;7;They are a very high level product, and with great safety
9118;6;I believe that BASF is a very large multinational company, with different businesses throughout the world, where it has highly developed and advanced processes. For our specific product such as adhesives, in the industry where I work, I have not had the opportunity to compare it with another supplier, but we continually work as a team to improve our management and constantly communicate. I think we still have many opportunities for improvement and development.
9119;7;Due to the lack of presence of the Company, in support of medium and small customers
9120;7;Is that the approach process is very bureaucratic, especially for small clients such as ours.
9121;5;Quality and service
9122;6;product quality and on-time delivery.
9123;6;Post-sale problems
9124;7;Supplier with good technical solutions, however we have faced many problems in the progress of the activities due to the high degree of bureaucracy in the processes and low speed of return. We have faced many problems with internal errors that end up directly impacting the business. We had a lot of billing errors and low pro Basf activity in adapting to the business model proposed by the client (new recon calculation methodology).
9125;5;"I've worked at BASF with a brewer responsible for DIVERGAN in Latin America and Central America and I know all the ISSUES that teams need to overcome.

 And as a BASF distributor for over 20 years, I can say that BASF is a solid company and that it has very high quality products.

 I think there are points for improvement, but in general I would definitely recommend BASF.

 I take this opportunity to praise the excellent work of three people who contribute a lot to the good development of the business. Bruna Marcatti, Fernando Garcia Nunes and Joana Kaori Yamazaki."
9126;5;Little support in the commercial part does not interact itself. Business the idea is win and win
9127;7;Price is not so attractive
9128;5;They have little local stock and replenishment takes a long time
9129;6;"""Chronic"" problems with C40L, B36LN and B36L product packaging. Cardboard boxes without mechanical resistance suitable for the volume and type of material!"
9130;7;"This will depend on the structure of the business I'm referring to. BASF is a very bureaucratic company in its processes and in most situations it is UNILATERAL, always dictates the ""GAME"". The shopkeeper is hostage to a system."
9131;5;We were not happy with the credit assignments proposed by the company, which made the process very complicated.
9132;7;Quality materials and good after sales support of the technical part. I am always taken care of in the requests I make.
9133;6;Quality.
9134;5;I don't believe in commercial policy.
9135;7;"Basf,
 Very good company for product portfolio. But very uncompromising in the models and forms of negotiation.
 Daniel."
9136;6;The delivery times agreed with the supplier do not comply with what was agreed.
9137;6;is trustworthy
9138;5;as excellent repainting, but the price difference with the competition is very large.
9139;6;Because it has the backing of a transnational company and a world-class quality of its products all over the world. However, in the current situation of the Peruvian branch, it has to greatly improve its quality of service and customer assistance.
9140;5;It would be very useful if Basf could have some stock and not only through orders with a delivery date of 3 months
9141;5;Availability and prices in MPG and DPG
9142;7;we have problems with deliveries more than 6 months ago.
9143;5;They do not always have enough stock at BASF Peruana
9144;5;Quality is important but the rigidity of the credit bureaucracy does not help to generate a more fluid trust, especially with clients with several years of commercial relationship where they should, days but days less, in the deadlines to lock an order.
9145;7;They handle a wide portfolio of products
9146;5;The prices are good and the quality of the products as well. But they are not reliable in delivery times.
9147;7;Price / quality, Today there is a lot of competition and although basf is excellent quality, today more competitiveness is needed
9148;5;Little contact with the contract administrator
9149;7;"In Product quality, excellent.
 In Customer Service, there is a lot to improve."
9150;6;"Their products are excellent, even their attention is quite good under the circumstances, there are areas to improve such as;
 a) slow execution of the agreed projects
 b) attitude of avoiding the formalization of the agreements by BASF
 c) when items from different business units are purchased, the service declines"
9151;5;Quality Products
9152;5;It is a great company with a lot of technical support, but the southern cone is a bit relegated
9153;7;It is not the most agile company and in the products we require, it is usually difficult to receive a real interest in selling us. There are always availability problems or it seems that our market is not of interest to BASF.
9154;5;It is a good supplier, they usually meet the delivery dates
9155;7;By product quality
9156;7;"I have recommended to several, but everything goes through price issues. And even more so where there is a free zone region, I write to you from my region,
 Arica Parinacota. That we are inserted in this area, where it is impossible to compete
 With prices given in the Metropolitan region."
9157;6;Good service, lack of proactivity in bringing innovative solutions.
9158;5;Distancing.
9159;5;A lot of bureaucracy in the solution of pending issues
9160;6;The reasons are the difficulties in aligning the prices of BASF products with other resellers in the operating region, little support from the regional manager and an RTV that leaves much to be desired for our needs.
9161;5;The company is very stuck in its internal processes and is not concerned with understanding the customer's mind.
9162;5;Products have quality and present satisfactory results. However, the need for asset rotation required handling with other products from other companies
9163;7;FOR THE QUALITY OF ITS PRODUCTS
9164;6;most of the time there are products/solutions for my need. But I currently miss good front-line coaches
9165;7;Good quality in the products.
9166;6;Excellent chemicals and products, but have difficulties in understanding the demands of some sectors and change products and data without prior interaction with customers who use the products in their processes.
9167;5;Past problems with late delivery
9168;7;"Price dispersion at the tip
 Distancing of the basf/channel relationship
 Privileges one channel only"
9169;5;for the excellent quality of its products.
9170;5;Slow dispatches from suppliers, bad import scheduling, shortages of products in times of high demand.
9171;5;Basf's service and presence in the area have improved considerably. The only factor to improve is the availability of stock of some products in which the opportunity to sell them was lost because they were not available, such as Elmus for example.
9172;6;"It depends on the business area. In some of them, the answer is late or there is simply no answer. When asked for availability or price expectations, they will most likely say: ""I don't know, I don't have information."""
9173;5;Lately there has been less accurate information
9174;6;"The fact that the company is very departmentalized makes contact difficult and, in many cases, not even the employees themselves know who is responsible for certain products.
 The company adopts a clique policy, favoring some distributors and ignoring new players, thereby failing to generate new business and opportunities.
 The impression is that we have to beg to buy from BASF."
9175;5;We had business problems that undermined the trustworthiness of the relationship.
9176;5;Because the prices are the highest in the market
9177;7;I deal with business through its represented KEMIOK, and, in recent dispatches I have felt a lot of delay in the matter of verifying accounts for balances, I do not know if it is because they do not give timely follow-up or because the process is slow at the BASF headquarters. Quite apart from this, the cost of the product they offer us is high, and the payment conditions have not changed, not even for the time we have been with you as business associates.
9178;7;I would recommend it to large companies only as small ones are not the focus of BASF and therefore its low flexibility does not accommodate smaller clients.
9179;6;Stable company
9180;6;The quality / cost ratio must be evaluated in detail.
9181;7;Their products are good in tailings applications, and they also see after marker
9182;6;Good level of technical response, but not very flexible when adapting to the specific needs of our product
9183;7;The score refers to the entire Basf context, therefore it is not only technical
9184;5;good service
9185;7;It is a reliable company in terms of support and backing for being so large, however, personally with rejection issues, there has been a lot of delay in definitions, which impacts production processes.
9186;7;The products are of quality, the supply difficulties are improving
9187;6;changes in the market and the limited technical structure of customer support
9188;5;"They are sellers of commodities. They do not differentiate large clients from small clients.
 The price scales play against the large users and the sellers in order to sell 200 kg more destroy the market.
 They say that nobody represents them in the country and local companies use the BASF LOGO to say that their products carry their brand and we see that they import the same raw material from China !!!"
9189;7;"Feed back from technical and commercial areas coincide in an uncomfortable and stressful relationship.
 Although technically it is an impeccable company and it has always responded in this regard."
9190;6;For the modification of its marketing policy.
9191;6;Basf, is a responsible company in its products, quality and well positioned in the local market, we regret that they do not have cylinder presentations, but above all we have confidence in the products they sell.
9192;6;"The company has excellent products; but there is no performance in the operations - there is a lack of agility / organization that the sector needs.
 I work as a Purchasing Manager in a distribution channel, whenever I buy there is difficulty in receiving orders (from 8 to 60 days). We have already had confirmed shipments that never arrived and returned saying that we refused, which never happened. Today is 9/29/2020 and we did not receive products invoiced by BASF on 9/18/2020! The company should review its logistics partners and processes. We receive products with different prices for orders; products with change of packaging or shipping location without order adjustment (impacting price divergence). It is frustrating to buy and wait for the order to adjust the system, as well as adjust and at the time of receipt there is a discrepancy; it generates rework and a lot of wasted time.
 My opinion is based on comparison with BASF's major competitors in the agribusiness sector.
 I hope I helped, that's the goal."
9193;5;Unstable logistics and sourcing
9194;7;good, the company BASF is an organization that has had important changes at a structural level for the benefit of customers, profitable and attractive benefits, the only limitation is that its product palette is an old palette where innovation is not present today, we have Of course, it is not something caused by you but by regulatory limitations of the country.
9195;5;Sometimes the processes are very slow
9196;5;The market recognizes the quality of technologies worked by BASF in the agricultural sector, but this brand is being threatened by the lack of active in the company's main products.
9197;5;"In recent years, the distribution of Basf products has ceased to be attractive due to the fact that there is a lot of supply in the market and a deterioration in the margin.
 Despite being my biggest supplier, with a huge distance from competitors, it is not delivering margin."
9198;7;Undeniable quality. Products are not discussed. The score is not high, due to delayed bureaucratic processes, low execution of action plans, reactive and not proactive.
9199;6;Quality Products. Questionable sales policy in the last 3 years. Distributors lose interest in wearing the brand on their uniform.
9200;6;They have good products and good strategies, but their processes do not help and their policy is very rigid
9201;7;Basf is a company with good products, but in recent years it has been slow in product innovations and at a commercial level it is perceived as very focused on access to the field and is not protecting traditional marketers.
9202;7;It responds to the fact that in product quality the score would be 10, while in technical services it is 4 and in responses to various requests it is 6. If BASF takes up the technical aspects and the integration of its team to the field reality, the score would be between 9 and 10, the last two aspects are affecting the high quality of BASF products.
9203;6;Lack of support from Basf in commercial strategies and extreme difficulty in maintaining a transparent partnership.
9204;7;Because of having to work with very low margins that my business cannot support
9205;5;unfair competition selling generics as original, making prices unfair for us who work 100% suvinil.
9206;5;From my position as CFO I would not know how I could recommend BASF to a friend or colleague.
9207;5;The company has high quality products. Prices are also interesting, but the margin leaves something to be desired. I can't compete in big sales either
9208;7;LACK OF PRICE POLICY AMONG RESELLERS.
9209;7;Products and brand with great visualization, but the company is still very plastered with regard to the dissemination of material at the Point of Sale and lack of flexible payment terms. Since in the present moment in which we live, it would be a great optimization tool
9210;6;Good quality of products and competitive prices
9211;5;The service is good but I think delivery times could be improved.
9212;6;Personally, I think they are inflexible and customer service is deficient, I feel that you cannot be accessed. Lack of presence.
9213;5;"Delay in returning the requested information.
 Lack of clarity regarding internal processes."
9214;5;Difficulty in direct service and lot size.
9215;7;Very long lead times
9216;5;"I worked at BASF for 15 years. I know the virtues and not so many of the company.
 I keep the best memories of having had the opportunity for professional growth and the most important of having a source that allowed me to be the breadwinner."
9217;7;More speed is needed when making requests.
9218;5;we have had latex deliveries without meeting quality standards. The error was recently acknowledged after sending samples to an external laboratory.
9219;6;"BASF products have an undeniable quality, however, the company's system lacks the response time to any request - especially in the quality and import sectors -, which hinders the input distribution process.
 Also, the company still needs to adapt to national legislation and bureaucratic systems established by bodies such as ANVISA and MAPA, meeting the document requirements required by the entities."
9220;5;Demand service.
9221;5;Delay in confirming shipments and constant delay in relation to the requested delivery date, even when the order is placed well in advance.
9222;7;Product delivery logistics are poor.
9223;7;It has very good products, but they are very disorganized, so it is difficult to give a high score.
9224;5;The size of the company does not allow it to easily and quickly reach customers with all the real opportunities it could provide to generate value for customers. Smaller and fewer companies
9225;5;I believe that the company offers a very good portfolio and product quality with a great regional coverage and is a very well structured company, it is not a 10 because it is not so flexible on some occasions with client requests.
9226;7;We have BASF as a partner for 40 years, I see a lot of difficulties in negotiating. The distributor that serves smaller stores, makes sales conditions that we are not able to make the price. These sales outlets only use SUVINIL to make other sales from other brands.
9227;7;It is a good company.
9228;6;The score was not higher, due to the lack of current MP (MDI), being provided below the historical average and some logistical problems in the year.
9229;5;It is necessary, an adjustment of focus in the development of new projects, hitting the target, I observe a certain elitization, in dealing with clients, where those who make it happen are not heard, only higher hierarchical levels.
9230;5;BASF has technology, but the price is higher, it's a decision that needs to be put in the balance.
9231;7;Very expensive products in relation to the market and lack of products.
9232;6;Solid company, good products but looking for more creativity in business
9233;5;PQ LEAVES DESIRING ABOUT SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE INK
9234;7;"- Eliminate financial cost of installment 60/75/90
 - Improve payment terms to 60/90/120 without vendor
 - Improve delivery logistics, broken products"
9235;6;"It is a company that presents quality products, but with regular price competitiveness.
 With the recent problems (second in a short period) of vitamin A, there is a concern with the contingency plan that the company has in cases of force majeure and also with security."
9236;7;Excellent products but very slow response to the customer. In addition to a very high turnover. From the commercial team
9237;7;We have been 3 consecutive years where they leave us stranded with assembled orders almost 6 months in advance.
9238;6;Good relationship with customers
9239;6;They have to improve delivery times and hopefully keep more products in place.
9240;7;"Quick response to requests, always willing to help, quality products
 Improving attention to deadlines. In our last catalytic converter purchase, a part of it was ready in the nick of time, being necessary to come by plane and with a large amount of broken catalytic converter."
9241;6;is a company that contributes in cutting-edge technology, it serves to be up to date in innovation
9242;6;Noy local production
9243;7;Support is required on technical issues.
9244;5;We have had problems with the product that, although not serious, do not allow us to work with it with confidence. Beyond that the position of the seller was always proactive and cooperative with us, it was not possible to advance to a point of total stability. And on the other hand, the delivery service in terms of meeting requested and confirmed dates always suffers significant delays, which limits the possibility of purchasing a larger volume.
9245;5;good quality of products but little flexibility and adaptation to the local market.
9246;6;In my opinion, there is a lack of flexibility, the internal processes are long in order to give an agile response to the client, greater deployment to clients in innovative products, improve competitiveness
9247;7;"It has a very good technical backing.
 The cancellation is the communication in case of dispatch problems or product alternatives."
9248;7;We still use very little to get a more conceptual idea. We would need to have a higher volume of use to get a better idea
9249;5;The availability of the products in a timely manner are extremely important in these times, that is the point to improve.
9250;6;THE PRODUCTS ARE GOOD, THE MARKETING IS NOT SO MUCH. THE INTERESTS FOR MORA USURERS.
9251;6;"BASF has great products, but an impossible financial policy for an SME.
 It generates ND without mediating the damages it causes, in some cases with usurious interests.
 The commercial sector always responds very well."
9252;7;The attention that I have had from the executives has been good but the service is slow in the quotes, in the sending of samples and in the shipments.
9253;6;It is a good company, with good products.
9254;5;We have not been able to reestablish communication and business that we did for some time
9255;6;In my sector, which is Agro, they have a commercial policy that promotes a price war among their distributors, for which the margins deteriorate seriously.
9256;7;Very rigid policies and very low margins
9257;6;"No contact of the leadership team with important clients
 Concentration of actions & decisions in central offices; but they DO NOT make any decisions to support business continuity
 Very far from the market - they have no idea what is happening in the Distribution Channel, much less with the Farmers"
9258;7;They are not clear on discounts for promotions
9259;7;Commercial terms
9260;5;has good quality products
9261;6;"They fail in communication and customer service.
 They fail to supply products."
9262;7;"The recommendation does not depend solely on a unilateral decision, it has other condiments that include the situation of the friend / colleague, their intentions and their location in the context.
 Example if it were to work in Basf it would be a 10. If it were to work with Basf they enter to validate the other condiments"
9263;5;Slowness in offices
9264;7;They only contact us when we require product
9265;5;Delivery times are very slow and they have no product when we need them.
9266;6;The line has lost the profitability expected for a portfolio of specialties
9267;7;There is still work to be done to achieve not only the focus on Sell In, but also to seek a collaborative approach on Sell Out and fair Trading Conditions in the market.
9268;7;Because it is very good
9269;5;Its large size as an organization makes it inflexible and slow to react.
9270;6;good products
9271;7;"We did an activity called ""TEAR DOWN"" to survey ideas and proposals where BASF participated, on the occasion BASF proposed several ideas but there was no continuity of these studies. As BASF has a very qualified technical team, we understand that we have lost the opportunity to increase business."
9272;6;The quality of BASF is a favorable point, they should work on the competitiveness of commercial offers.
9273;5;I have no comments
9274;7;"For the quality and guarantee of the products
 For the good attention of its collaborators"
9275;6;In order to access competitive conditions, I have to buy things in volumes that I do not want or things that do not interest me so much, whether in packages or individual products such as soybeans.
9276;5;The price level and payment term in the negotiations is reduced.
9277;6;Good service, but needs greater clarity in the negotiations,
9278;7;recommendation
9279;5;My decision is based on the moment we live in, at another time my indication would be 10
9280;6;Today, the price and margin standards practiced in our region, concomitantly with the pressure for inventories, I am not comfortable in recommending Basf fully to a storekeeper friend.
9281;7;For the points mentioned above.
9282;7;They demand very high liters and even in this pandemic that we are living they didn't make it easy for the logistician.
9283;5;Good service, but we do not always obtain the certificates of the purchased raw materials and the person we contact always refers us to the web.
9284;6;Long delivery time, and with delays.
9285;5;BASF has a robust structure (production / laboratories) and has competent people.
9286;6;Basf usually respects agreed delivery dates and has an acceptable response time for inquiries
9287;7;"- Inflexible logistics
 - Continuous missing
 - Quick response from the commercial sector"
9288;5;Trust issues.
9289;6;the Product is very good but very expensive
9290;6;BY THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PREVIOUS SELLER ...
9291;7;It has a wide palette of products. excellent formulations good presentation of clear containers on their labels. good technical support in the field or if you have any questions, they respond as soon as possible.
9292;5;the company has a good portfolio, but it lacks the logistics and strategy for HF
9293;6;good products and warranty
9294;6;Good performance products
9295;5;They are good products, but to get good discounts the volumes are very high
9296;7;attractiveness level
9297;7;Product availability, response time to complaints or concerns is not good
9298;7;"BASF known worldwide for the quality of its products, but it has many drawbacks in terms of packaging, labeling, regulatory information. Labeling problems constantly arise, the same ones that remain; momentary solutions are implemented, such as putting film around the label to prevent detachment, lowering its quality and presentation, putting the product into question.
 Necessary and definitive action needs to be taken for recurring presentation, labeling and technical label information problems."
9299;7;It has good products and its people are educated and know a lot. In some materials their materials are expensive.
9300;7;Basf is a large company that can serve Tier 2 and 3 customers. It has active technology and development area, and for this reason I would recommend them.
9301;5;Very extensive development loops. Low reactivity to problems
9302;5;Product quality and experience
9303;6;Excellent quality of commercials, but at the moment with big problems in the performance of your product.
9304;7;Extremely reliable company in its products
9305;5;Product with a lot of acceptance in the market of my region
9306;5;I could list the following qualities: seriousness, product quality, team training. On the other hand, the following points to be improved: logistics, understanding of the client's business and respect for it.
9307;5;Sales policy, price war for the same product, purchased from different channels (retailer with distribution). Unfair competition between resellers of the same brand (Suvinil/Suvinil and not between Suvinil/Coral).
9308;7;Quality Issues in Granite Crystall FCA
9309;6;We know the quality of Basf's product, however, the low availability and constant changes in the schedule make inventory scheduling very difficult.
9310;5;The type of material we buy at BASF is not meant to be indicated to anyone, and we would never like BASF to offer the same type of material to a competitor as ours, this could affect the customer / supplier relationship.
9311;5;It is a very good company, but they fail a lot in service and quality
9312;6;"In terms of quality, BASF products meet very demanding standards. However, the life time of the product is also evaluated in comparison to its similar; in this case, BASF does not revalidate products or issue shelf life extension letters, for this reason it will be very difficult for the distributor to face such a scenario."
9313;5;"THE INVASION OF AREA WITH PRICE PROSTITUTION, PROMOTED AND SPONSORED....
 QDO. THERE IS PERMISSION FOR ANOTHER CHANNEL, THIS SELLER CONTRACTS HERE TO ACCESS THE SAME CUSTOMERS WE SERVED FOR YEARS;
 SELL AT LOWER PRICES Q. OUR PURCHASE PRICE AND THE MOST SERIOUS:
 ""DISAPPEAR, NOT GIVING ASSISTANCE; LETTING THE CUSTOMER APPLY IN ANY WAY RESULTING IN INEFFICIENT CONTROL"" (BURNING BASF PRODUCTS)
 ***DO NEW CUSTOMERS ACCESS? NO.
 ***MARKET SHARE OF BASF PRODUCTS? THE SAME..."
9314;6;"Renowned company, quality products and committed to society's well-being.
 We expected to be more important than we are treated"
9315;6;The grade could be better, but currently there is an excess of Basf supply in the market. Many channels in the same area, especially cooperatives.
9316;6;Lack of transparency, organization and turnover of people
9317;6;"Cutting-edge products,
 Defects, poor service, it takes time to solve a problem and logistics doesn't work"
9318;6;Company with good prices and portfolio
9319;5;"Although I am ""called"" an ELO Customer by the Company, I was not given any credit for doing business, despite a very old History within the Company.

 There seems to be an incompatibility between the Commercial (which calls me ELO, knows my History), and the Financial, which did not take this History into consideration just because I am not the holder of the Rural Producer IE for a few decades of relationship!! !"
9320;6;I believe that Basf has to improve the speed of solving quality problems and provide faster solutions for them. In 2019, we had serious quality problems and BASF's posture, in general, was not satisfactory, both in terms of the speed of resolution and in terms of dealing with the problem. They need to improve this approach.
9321;6;They have very good products, with adequate technical specifications, permanent and very fast advice regarding the functionality of the products. I do not put more qualification due to the attention of customer care in logistics
9322;5;I rated it 6 because in my opinion BASF lacks paying more attention to its smaller customers, as I suffer a lot of pressure from BASF managers and consultants when I do a promotion or lower the price of my products for sale, I have already suffered threats to increase my purchase price, which I think has already happened, as BASF's biggest customers in recent months are offering some SUVINIL products almost equal to my cost price, and deposits of construction materials that are not even specialized only in paint and buy of the distribution, they are managing to offer SUVINIL products well below mine, and I have complained several times to my consultant, and he tells me that he will look and resolve, but has not resolved. I have 2 stores, one in Paraopeba which is in the Central region of Minas, 100km from BH and the other store is in Varzea da Palma in the North region of Minas, they are different regions and I think there should be different consultants, because my consultant who is from the northern region of minas is not able to serve me well here in Paraopeba, I am not having the necessary assistance, because so many of my competitors with purchasing power much higher than mine and competitors with purchasing power much lower than mine are managing to offer their products in a way that I can't compete, it's getting complicated to work this way. I had plans to open another branch, but due to the lack of assistance and the difficulties they are encountering, I find it impracticable to try to work in another store with Suvinil. In 8 years in the store I have never been so difficult to sell my product, because BASF requires a lot of goals, I try to beat them all, but the goals are very exaggerated and hard to beat, because I have bought too much product, no need to hit the goal and they are not managing to sell much, because the competition is offering their products almost equal to my purchase price.
9323;7;BEST TRADING CONDITION TO MONITORING THE MARKET
9324;5;"The products generate reliability within the Colombian market, however, the production and logistics times are not competitive.-
 Thank you"
9325;6;Due to permanent product changes without maintaining a stable and coherent line with what this implies in the economic variables.
9326;7;The products are of good quality but the time it takes to have a sample is too long.
9327;5;It is a reliable company and its products are of good quality.
9328;7;COMPANY HAS GOOD PRODUCTS AND GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SERVICE, BUT LEAVE WISHING IN COMMERCIAL POLICY AND LOGISTICS
9329;7;Not all business units are the same, they do not provide the same support. Some disorganization is perceived.
9330;6;It has a wide portfolio and very good quality, but the price is not competitive.
9331;5;Due to the reliability and quality of the products. However, flexibility in service and availability is very low.
9332;6;"BASF has been constantly withdrawing products from the line, and the deadline for customers of these products to receive action is extremely short.
 Knowing that many of these components are in OEM formulations, care in this issue should be differentiated.
 It is difficult to recommend BASF with this kind of arrogance."
9333;5;Good products, good service
9334;5;Basf is sinning a lot in its relationship with channels
9335;5;For product application safety
9336;6;due to the degree of demands in the partnership !!!
9337;6;quality, service
9338;7;It is a great brand with excellent solutions.
9339;5;Business transparency
9340;5;the negotiations are very stressful, as a large basf customer we would have to have a better financial result, I don't know if it's worth all this effort to buy basf
9341;7;It has good products, but with little commercial plasticity.
9342;5;Good prices. good products. as a negative, perhaps the deliveries coming from BsAS are delayed a bit. although they have improved a lot
9343;7;Very good products but at too high prices.
9344;7;We have some products that would need more standardization in production, and unfortunately, that's not what we showed.
9345;6;at
9346;6;There is inflexibility in commercial terms and I don't see much effort in evaluating opportunities across the chain that could be beneficial to both companies.
9347;7;difficult to place orders, personal service was much better, the marketing of pigments and concentrates via IMCD made it difficult and increased the price of products. the targeting for small companies in Brazil is bad, even though they belong to a large German group, as in our case.
9348;6;Basf lacks a lot of flexibility.
9349;5;They must considerably improve the commercial area
9350;6;The quality is guaranteed, the cost can become a disadvantage.
9351;6;It is evolving in terms of partnership. It has always been very corporate, with no concern for partnership.
9352;5;good morning it seems to me that Basf does not take into account all the client's needs
9353;5;The products are good, but every day its product portfolio is more limited and its logistics is complex.
9354;5;Shows little interest in the customer.
9355;7;It has an extensive portfolio and high performance products, increasing the level of reliability and robustness in the processes
9356;6;The lack of technical assistance would lead me not to recommend BASF, however, the commercial service was very good.
9357;5;The service needs to improve in terms of innovation in support of the processes. I am still working with old methodologies that no longer provide greater value, nor do they make them different from the rest
9358;5;Response time and service could be faster and more accurate.
9359;7;It is a quality product.
9360;7;there is always room for improvement
9361;5;There have been situations in the company that have led us to have serious supply problems. Eg ibuprofen
9362;6;The customer service is good, however it has communication failures that affect the coordination of receptions and production planning
9363;6;It is a great company, but generally very slow in responding to customer needs.
9364;5;it takes a long time to fill orders, it fills 60, 80% of the order, complicated logistics.
9365;6;sss
9366;5;Quality
9367;5;I would recommend the quality of BASF products, but not the agility of the service
9368;5;Because in recent years, they have modified the strategy, without considering the most loyal strategic partners, terribly damaging our market share.
9369;5;Expensive prices
9370;5;The products comply with quality but are outside the average price range of the market. On the other hand, supply times are quite long and there is little technical support service as regards the food sector.
9371;5;Very good product quality, very good customer service. Fulfillment of deliveries or availabilities, sometimes not so efficient.
9372;5;Absolutely proven products, high quality, and technological development. Personally, I could not put 10 for not knowing 100% of the potential of the Basf nutrition product palette.
9373;6;pricing policy above market prices
9374;6;We have a lot of difficulty in the relationship with BASF, there is an inflexibility in the negotiations and they become extremely dependent on external decisions for local sales, where we identify a global price drop for a specific product and even so we can't manage any kind of negotiation here.
9375;7;It will depend on the area of influence of my friend, profile, segment.
9376;6;They have products of excellent quality and performance, but they are extremely inflexible commercially, especially with those that sell the most, and with the unpresentable small businesses they give very favorable conditions.
9377;7;Although it has a good product line, the company does not seem to focus on the agricultural business, it does not have a targeted distribution policy making any distributor focus and support at the field level to its customers (producers). It needs to be more objective, strengthening itself before its competitors and with the producer.
9378;6;"lack of agility
 response time
 Delivery delays"
9379;7;quality products
9380;7;They have excellent products but management and attention are very bad. They must be one of the worst companies in terms of administrative management.
9381;6;The paint is very good but the people who work at BASF do not give a solution to the problems, we have been waiting for a solution for months and there is no response from anyone, thank you
9382;5;According to my experience, in the last time I feel that I have received the documentation after having requested it with a certain level of insistence, after them I find the service excellent.
9383;7;We had many problems with availability of products for delivery in previous years
9384;6;They have an excellent product portfolio, but they do not adjust their business projection to the real market value or rather to the conditions of the agricultural market.
9385;5;Grade 7 was given. But Basf cannot turn a mestil on every corner if it is difficult, it needs to support more partners in conditions. In my region Pouso Alegre and more HF fast cycle cultures we don't even have an ATS to help us.
9386;5;For the support provided by BASF and predisposition.
9387;5;Faults in the Service of the programmed products. Lack of information as to the reason for DELAYED DELIVERIES. Need for a contact at the Managerial and/or Board level, for faster and more concrete solutions.
9388;5;They still need to improve their attention to emails (faster responses) and more agile resolution of problems that usually arise.
9389;7;Good quality and good technical service
9390;5;Good products, more communication is lacking
9391;6;The Company has good products More in the Lubricants line the service is not good.
9392;6;Prices are not the best in the market.
9393;5;"Portfolio, R&D, Rebate.
 Negative point: regional price unevenness."
9394;5;It has a good portfolio and apparently with a more adjusted commercial policy than in recent years.
9395;7;The technical quality of the raw materials is indisputable, as well as the documentary subsidy. However, I still realize that it is difficult to serve small companies, in the commercial aspect, with agility and conditions through the processes of a large company, such as Basf. It is necessary to adjust this parameter internally to serve smaller companies.
9396;6;The Atagel 50 we bought from Basf is still different from what we received in 2017 and 2018 and we are having several problems in production
9397;6;The service leaves something to be desired, we have no return on requests.
9398;7;High quality products, but they take some time to respond to requests
9399;6;Normally I would have given a 10, but during 2019 we had some quality problem that, despite being quickly resolved, disturbed us a lot. I hope they can recover my 10th grade in the coming months while maintaining the level of service and superior technical support that BASF has always delivered.
9400;5;Commercially, we have a fast service, but when it comes to the qualification process, that is, document evaluation, fillings and feedback, this takes a long time at BASF. Today, we basically stopped doing business with BASF for the item Pluriol A 750E, due to lack of document and return.
9401;5;Quality in service and products
9402;6;Little flexibility with dispatches from origin, arrears.
9403;6;Long time in response to the request, or they do not respond.
9404;5;The problem of territories between distributors has not been resolved and the investment made in inventories is always at risk
9405;6;In the first instance, it was difficult for them to respond to my request for a quote. Later, when they contacted me from Argentina, they told me that in Chile they could attend to me, and in Chile the answer took too long. We finally got the product in Chile.
9406;6;"They should have a discount, even in time, not by sections, there are businesses that never manage to reach the sections,
 I buy in other companies, and the amount to buy does not matter. The same discount is always maintained,"
9407;5;Good products and date compliments
9408;5;The attention and speed of the answers to the doubts or request for quotes is very effective.
9409;6;They have very volatile materials inventory availability, we don't really know what to expect month after month, and they have a very internal view of the business.
9410;7;have a large portfolio, but response times are not the best
9411;5;Regarding the logistics area, they do not have stock, they cancel PO issued for the year without prior notice. Regarding Quality, the products arrive with wrong data.
9412;7;Good products, but the attention or lead times are not the most appropriate. Lack of support in market product applications
9413;7;It could generate a higher score but the production Lead Time is very long and the processes of confirmation of stock availability as well.
9414;7;Delay in resolving calls.
9415;5;Goals are disproportionate. They do not align with the number of inhabitants of the city and the GDP
9416;7;Suvinil has a good relationship with us, excellent products, good market penetration with its strong brand, but it is the company within our business that leaves the lowest margin result and has the worst delivery among our suppliers.
9417;5;high goals
9418;6;I think that Suvinil would have to pay more attention to customers like Dicafer, I mean, medium-sized customers, because today only large customers are the ones who get attention, and I think that everyone is a customer, because this large one may no longer exist in the future, as these medium and small grow. I think there has to be actions such as magic moments, for smaller customers, then we would have more contact with the board, managers, in short, the customer relationship with Suvinil, today we only have the figure of the Suvinil salesperson, who serves us well, but we only got to him.
9419;7;as it is a credible company but with some limitations in the actions, that is, it needs to be faster in making important decisions.
9420;5;Inflexibility in negotiation, distrust of partners, regression in product launches.
9421;7;Sales policies make business transactions difficult.
9422;6;They have good concepts, developments and theoretical commercial technical support, however in practice the support falls a little short, since by needing to carry out instrumental tests that support the claims sought through the raw materials included in the projects.
9423;5;Basf customer service is not very good.
9424;7;Lack of visibility of the current account. Today I do not have a website to check the general status of the account.
9425;6;A consolidated company with many innovations, however, could present more innovations to its customers, delays in some deliveries, harming production volume.
9426;6;We had some difficulties with the introduction of the 580 technology and we are still making improvements in the process for adaptation, I understand that there was also a failure on the Maxion side, but my expectations were much higher. I also understand that restructurings were made at BASF and we are finding a way.
9427;5;Service and quality.
9428;6;little or no flexibility in negotiations
9429;7;Difficult to proactively bring improvements and difficult to implement the process improvements we propose
9430;6;Lately I've been having excessive billed price problems with divergence that take almost (or more than) two months to be corrected. This has been impacting the cost of material.
9431;5;"Payment deadline
 TC setting"
9432;7;"High employee turnover;
 Employees prioritize sales volume and not product development;
 We lost major negotiations with larger producers for not following the price table."
9433;5;They are reliable products, of excellent quality, but a response service with insufficient agility, not because of the staff that attends us, who is always efficient, but because of the bureaucratic response of the company itself.
9434;6;Reference company in the chemical market.
9435;7;Good portfolio. Very friendly seller.
9436;5;many companies in the market
9437;7;We have little business with Basf for a deeper assessment
9438;6;Serious company that fulfills its commitments.
9439;5;"good products and service.
 High prices."
9440;5;Good products but not always with good technical assistance.
9441;6;The commercial support is positive, however the quality of the products (labels) have presented many drawbacks. Additionally, they have the lowest level of service in terms of local logistics of all our suppliers, they take much longer than the market standard.
9442;5;Customer service is good, however they sometimes take time to respond to requests.
9443;5;"Very good products; regular service and prices."
9444;5;Bad Logistics
9445;5;THIS LAST YEAR THE SERVICE AND THE RESPONSES ARE VERY SLOW.
9446;5;Note 7 , it is a company that has good products , is serious in recommending the field and is always close to the customer in solving problems .
9447;7;basf has an excellent portfolio, but does not offer an area protection policy for its channels, there is a lot of cannibalism among distributors, the partnership could be better
9448;5;Excellent products, however, lack technical assistants in the field and prices compatible with those of competitors
9449;7;The products are of good quality
9450;7;Mismatch and difficulty of information, access policy to Direct Selling X Distribution, Remuneration policy, distance from RTV.
9451;5;A solid company, however, it still lacks ethics in the pricing of its products.
9452;6;excellent products
9453;6;Commercial attention is easier to get in customer service.
9454;5;Excellent technical support but with some rigidity in commercial / financial matters.
9455;7;"The products are varied because they have different lines of business, in addition, they are of very good quality.
 However, the technical service can improve."
9456;5;I would like a faster delivery of your products
9457;5;The service is good, however we see unclear the volumes and prices of their products in the market.
9458;7;Product of excellent quality, but placement on insufficient ground.
9459;6;"Good products,
 and basfontheroad presence"
9460;7;Quality Products
9461;5;"Excellent quality products.
 It is necessary to improve aspects of logistics in dispatch."
9462;6;good products, lousy logistics, it is difficult to trust that it will arrive on time
9463;6;for 100% reliable quality, good technical assistance from your work team.
9464;5;MANY PROBLEMS
9465;6;They have good products. However, we have had problems when continuing the business with a client. Competing directly with BASF.
9466;6;"Technical assistance ok.
 Regarding the availability of deliveries, we have had a very tight stock due to lack of it, due to a commercial issue."
9467;6;They are not always very expeditious in resolving disputes
9468;7;Excellent products
9469;6;"Response time has increased a lot... both from the commercial part and from the technical part and quality.
 For emergency care and supply it is satisfactory."
9470;6;Because for more than a year the responses to inquiries and services have improved a lot.
9471;5;"(punctuation is bad punctuated !!)

 Very good products. Service must improve"
9472;5;Brand of supplies and proven efficiency.
9473;5;BASF products are very good for their quality. However, they are TOO expensive compared to other brands that are of the same BASF quality. I think BASF is not being realistic with the reality of the market. On the other hand, there are now a number of generics on the market that are as good as the brands that BASF represents. BASF must adjust its prices to something more realistic, they are well above the market.
9474;7;efficiency
9475;5;Good communication and transparent.
9476;7;I think there are points that could be improved
9477;6;Well, in terms of logistics, the company still needs to improve.
9478;5;difficulties in negotiating prices and targets that force high inventories, regardless of the turnover of the merchandise.
9479;5;suitable brand - strong partnership - well-accepted brand in the market - the problem of the low margin that leaves ...
9480;7;Although Suvinil has excellent products. The profitability of Suvinil products is very low due to great competition in the market.
9481;6;At the moment I don't know the entirety of Basf's portfolio, but I know the quality of the company.
9482;7;The quality of the products justifies the recommendation, but the customer support, the prices with discrepant variations and the lack of response in several support areas justify the low recommendation score.
9483;7;BASF has excellent material, but with ridiculous technical assistance.
9484;6;The BASF company recognized worldwide with high quality products, in logistics processes, response times, recall, regulatory, has shortcomings that affect its commercialization and negotiations.
9485;6;"Positive: High quality and performance products.
 Negative: high prices, very high minimum purchase, complex communication channels."
9486;6;It has product availability, it is an advantage that they send us from the USA, since for emergencies the product can be obtained earlier
9487;6;Tangled commercial programs and you need to be monitoring very punctually ¡¡¡
9488;7;As a company with the portfolio it has it is considered very good, but with policies for resale without standard.
9489;5;Broad portfolio with strategic products for crop management. On the other hand, it maintains a pricing policy that is not consistent with the market and is sometimes not plausible. Difficulty delivering the negotiated products.
9490;6;"Great products, trade policy is missing; margin for resellers and respect for the areas of expertise."
9491;5;Given that the demand for the product at the local level is relatively low, it is understood that we do not have a permanent representation. This contributes to a rating that you can improve.
9492;5;A large product and company, however, finds it difficult to develop custom products
9493;7;It has an excellent portfolio, with good development in the field, but a heavy structure for decision making, slow in liquidation of programs and bonuses
9494;7;It is a risk business
9495;5;Delay in email responses, some late deliveries and lack of information in case of delays
9496;7;Variety of products.
9497;6;Little flexibility in the face of temporary changes.
9498;6;Good products. Service to improve
9499;5;IT HAS GOOD PRODUCTS, BUT THE PRICES ARE ABOVE THE COMPETITORS
9500;6;Due to the slowness that it is at the moment, delaying in billing, there is no RTV in the region
9501;5;A company whose products in its portfolio have a price dispersion that borders on outrage. Differences for the SAME TYPE OF BUSINESS that easily exceed 15%. The BRL 100.00 bill from the South is worth less than the BRL 100.00 bill from the Midwest
9502;7;"GOOD PRODUCTS
 LOW COMMERCIAL AND POSITIONING FLEXIBILITY"
9503;7;"Serious company, good products, good people.
 Portfolio a little scarce in some areas. Distribution channel too large. There is a lot of competition between the same ""BASF"""
9504;5;"Depending on the sector, they respond in an agile and fast way (additives for plastics and Lubricants), but on the other hand, in the home care sector, they take a long time to respond-

 On the other hand, we consider that the products are of high quality, but in many cases it is difficult to confirm availability at origin."
9505;5;they give me security
9506;7;BASF is a great company but it lacks Blood
9507;6;Very good company, with a commitment, not very clear in Argentina
9508;5;Regarding the line products, they are of excellence. In terms of technological innovation and the opening of new raw materials according to the rotation and adaptation of the market, they are quite relegated.
9509;7;The result of this last year has been very bad in terms of quality and the alternatives provided by BASF for correcting them are not giving the desired results.
9510;7;Commercial Economic Relations.
9511;6;Prices are not very competitive and commercial service has only started to improve this year.
9512;6;When campaigns are carried out with the company I work for, no problem, but if not, we are always out of the market.
9513;5;"I work with sugar cane in Nova Independência - SP, Pedra Agroindustrial group, and I think that the service is flawed, as the RTV that is responsible for serving the Matrix is the same that serves us, with a distance of 450 km between the units. Another point is that the herbicide portfolio is reduced.
 However, the insecticide part is excellent, as well as the fungicide part."
9514;6;In my point of view, the company is not round, several companies complaining about lack of product and logistical problems, it takes a long time to come out with ai Bayer campaign and Syngenta takes the market, prices are not competitive, distance from RTV, in my case, we have branch in 3 states, RTV is in São Paulo, what is the chance of serving GO and TO, None. This new system of placing one RTV per channel sucks, prices are unadjusted by region and we are totally without support (I'm not taking into account telephones, but technical visits). To have a base, it must be more than 1 year since the BASF RTV does not sit down with my team to have a conversation, and I don't blame him because he lives in Sp, I blame BASF for the lack of preparation, therefore BASF every year there is less revenue at the store, the only reason it hasn't gone down to zero is because I didn't want to put another company that has good fungicides like CORTEVA.
9515;5;COMMERCIAL ISSUES AND PRODUCT AVAILABILITY
9516;7;Basf is a company, which is helping with Resellers, placing goals above reality, where to obtain the goals in some cases, we are selling at prices below costs and To follow the market we are working most of the portfolio without margin.. .
9517;7;Many channels offer Basf products, causing huge cannibalism in the market.
9518;5;"The marketing policy that BASF practices in the field has drastically reduced the net result of sales operations for its products year after year.
 My recommendation is average because I see that this policy shows no signs of being reversed, that is, each year the distributor will lose more space and will no longer earn enough to remain in the market"
9519;7;Serious company, with good products, in terms of warehouse supply when the product is not there, I must admit that the supply of purchase orders is slow compared to other chemicals
9520;7;little performance in the regional Camda Penápolis.
9521;6;because in my region we still don't have basf support and we didn't receive any visit from rtv, since luciana and at junior came and we managed to place products in the branch! because we were 2 years without products !!!
9522;6;A long story
9523;7;"Delay in delivery of products
 Incomplete dispatch, missing materials"
9524;6;Little product renewal
9525;7;cost x benefit
9526;5;"Excellent products, however ""allocation"" is complex.

 Petrizzio is a Laboratory that sells in retail, which we all know how it is, Basf is too rigid with payment dates, which is not consistent with our market."
9527;5;There is compliance in the quantities and the prices in some lines are competitive, but in the logistics issues that imply arrival dates and level of service to be agile between the arrival of the ships and the delivery to the customer must improve.
9528;5;Due to delivery problems on time.
9529;5;the products are good but the issue of production costs in some products are more expensive than the competition
9530;5;Products, Services and network.
9531;6;For some time now, I feel your company is quite distant from us as a distributor, although it is true that the relationship with Erika is very cordial, we do not have only a transactional relationship today and there are no long-term or joint work plans.
9532;7;Lack of special prices for volumes, and support in the field.
9533;7;Field service, commercial conditions
9534;7;It can always improve. Especially on the issue of price
9535;5;"Delivery is very slow
 SW is much more efficient."
9536;6;Great quality in the products, great demand in the resale, but it leaves very little margin for the business, even for being a market leader, it attracts very aggressive competition to the retailers.
9537;6;I have a lot of difficulty working with Basf-Suvinil, due to low profitability and lack of agility in several aspects on the part of Basf.
9538;6;Sales price policy.
9539;7;"good lead time service
 good product"
9540;7;"Good products and punctual delivery.
 Very long product delivery time.
 We had a problem with a product and the help to solve it was insufficient."
9541;7;Very slow response, I provide support for technical queries about your product line, it does not go beyond the technical issues that are requested.
9542;6;Good products, but market organization is weak
9543;7;For the sake of people. Behavior of some people in the company.
9544;5;Basically, more proactive assistance is expected and not reactive to problems.
9545;6;It has the knowledge, skills and responsibility appropriate to our needs.
9546;5;"Disorganized trade policy in the countryside, a mess.
 In 2017 it was like this, it improved in 2018 and now in 2019 it's complicated, our competitors' channels offering in the field at a price lower than our cost, who explains that to me?
 So today I don't know if I would recommend BASF."
9547;5;BASF has great products but the service and logistics don't work well
9548;5;Yes, due to the quality of the products and the variability of solutions available for different applications.
9549;5;I understand BASF as a respectable company with great lines, reliable products, a good portfolio is a great level of research, but with confusing low-profit commercial policies, many distributor conflicts (many in the same areas) and very little dialogue with your distributor.
9550;6;The company has had and has good products, but in my case in particular, stop working with the SUVINIL brand (Basf stopped marketing it in the country), at the time, it caused me at the time a void in that quality of products, since although it was replaced by CASABLANCA, it was not the same, and some time later, once the CASABLANCA products were completed, it also did the same with it. Understandably, it was probably not convenient, but for those of us who sold those products it caused us harm. There were also many personnel changes (at least those who attended me), and there were moments that I had no reference within Basf.
9551;7;Good predisposition and understanding of the business
9552;6;Because of the quality and delivery problems we have had. I think BASF should be well above the performance shown.
9553;6;In general BASF is an average provider, which does not stand out from the rest
9554;6;In the case of automotive dealers, they respect the marketing areas
9555;7;"Basf is an international company, with a good track record, good customer service.
 I consider the prices high compared to the rest of the market."
9556;5;Company focused on products with little intimacy with the customer. It has the worst price dispersion between resellers and direct sales in the agricultural market.
9557;5;"In the past, BASF was more our partner. It helped us much more to fight in the market. Now our biggest problem is that we generate demand for BASF products and so often cooperatives are the sellers.
 They are much bigger, sell from all the major brands and have much lower costs to the government.
 In this way, resellers are getting tighter every day.
 In short, we feel that we are continuing to do everything we did for BASF, but the opposite is not being true."
9558;6;company would be of good principles
9559;7;"Because when it comes to effectiveness and great quality.
 However, we are concerned about offering and not having the necessary demand for assistance."
9560;7;The company's portfolio is excellent, with great acceptance in the field, products of extreme quality and that deliver the result. The team is active and accessible. As negative points to justify the grade is the company's delay in launching its campaign in front of the main competitors, where its distributors are harmed in the market and, in addition, the bureaucracy and complexity of the company's processes and campaigns, which makes it difficult to work in the field.
9561;5;Basf has a good service and a desirable quality, but it does not provide flexibility.
9562;6;10 in relation to products, but I see that there is opportunity in the service, especially in terms of delivery and accuracy of information related to imported items (changes in terms).
9563;5;Due to the large number of historical changes that have been lost, they are being resumed.
9564;5;At times there is a lack of products of interest to us and at other times, price increases well above the competitors found in the market, this led us to direct purchases to other suppliers and to learn how to handle products other than those we use from BASF, eg . the PIRAT.
9565;5;I don't know the level of being a friend or colleague, but within the company, BASF is the only company that is working on it, and we continue to communicate that it has an advantage in terms of quality through Q & D. Outside the company, SAP performance simple experiments are open to the public at exhibitions.
9566;7;Delays in the processes.
9567;5;Due to lack of knowledge and use of the products offered by Basf
9568;7;Basf is an excellent company, but it has low flexibility in lead-time, prices, etc.
9569;5;We had many problems related to the maintenance of quality in the supply of PSA adhesives, ( Acronal 476 ), and delays in responding and solving the problems presented, generating unnecessary wear between customer-supplier.
9570;6;Delay in sending samples
9571;6;lack personal contact
9572;7;BASF is extremely efficient when it comes to creating molecules/products. However, it has a very rigid commercial policy, in addition to not being the most efficient in logistics.
9573;5;High prices and slow service.
9574;7;We have been having problems with the supply of the company's products, which is demanding a lot of effort from both parties to ensure that there is no lack of product at the plant with the risk of line stoppage.
9575;6;Contacting our local support is extremely difficult where I believe that BASF Brasil has a low perspective in relation to PLIB.
9576;5;Basf's products are good in their application, but the delivery time and the constant unavailability make us rethink about recommending the product.
9577;5;Many recent problems with lead time delays for acquisitions
9578;5;Services still below expectations for a recognized multinational company.
9579;5;Some raw materials are causing problems in the final products.
9580;5;Prices practiced by Basf is uncompetitive against its competitors.
9581;5;Commitment to the customer
9582;6;Wide diversified event that contributes to networking, negative points, many presentations and little time for questions and answers for the items covered
9583;7;Excellent service but we had serious problems with supplies issues.
9584;7;Very high quality products, but at the service level it is very bad and, even with countless feedbacks, there is no improvement. The impression is that the head office in Germany does not pay attention to the complaints that Brazil points out or that these complaints do not reach there for the necessary actions and improvement in the quality of service. The company loses a lot of sales to competitors that offer substitute products with prices and, above all, a much higher level of service. Sds
9585;7;There are many people in different businesses. They should centralize in one person when they have several businesses in the same company. Also, they practice extremely high prices.
9586;5;They are always available with products in addition to assistance with dispatching the material, without bureaucracy.
9587;5;I recommend it for being a power and important company in the market, but a very bureaucratic company with many hierarchies. No openness/freedom for decision making.
9588;7;Despite having high technical capacity in its products, I understand that it needs to improve in terms of technical assistance, in our case a low rate of innovation proposals and improvements in applications.
9589;5;Lack of technical assistance
9590;5;Sudden changes in the condition of products with slow communication.
9591;5;I like the company's products, the support of the technical staff, but I think there is only a lack of more open communication regarding the changes that may occur along the way with regard to raw materials.
9592;5;Little flexibility in negotiations.
9593;5;7 for considering the technical part of BASF, but if we take into account the management of the BASF group, mainly the coating area, the score would be much lower.
9594;5;Validity of items we receive, from time to time quality problems and delay in certain important points
9595;6;Basf is a technologically important Global Company and needs to increase contacts with Clients, to be closer.
9596;6;"Although the quality of BASF products is undeniable, and the support offered by the local team (quality and commercial) is satisfactory, I suggest some changes in terms of the company's posture regarding requests linked to national product quality laws.
 Since it has a considerable market in Brazil, it is necessary to adapt to Brazilian legislation, meeting the requirements of ANVISA (or sometimes MAPA) regarding the analyzes and parameters required in the RDCs, IN and the like. I understand that BASF's international production and quality parameter meets, in theory, the requirements of the Brazilian body. However, the lack of ""evidence"" leads the client, many times, to opt for other manufacturers, which provide the information, reports, certificates, methodologies and statements required by these institutions.
 Thanks for the attention,"
9597;7;Because BASF is a great player, it has many options. It is not ideal because it got too big and some answers never arrive.
9598;7;Good to excellent products, but some commercial differences.
9599;6;Product is of quality
9600;6;It is very difficult to find the person we have to talk to about a certain raw material.
9601;7;It is a reputable company that delivers the product with the desired quality
9602;5;"Basf has excellent products when Exclusive, with the exception of materials used for other applicators, we are lacking due to the low volume we use.
 Technical assistance has great specialists but low visits from them."
9603;7;A company we can count on, but with some inflexibility.
9604;5;Many documentation errors and shipping delays. The solution is also slow to occur.
9605;7;BASF's form of corporate governance prevents its top-level managers from being far from the reality of its clients. The suggestion is that they have in their agenda visits to strategic customers or projects together with customers so that this relationship is closer.
9606;7;Delay in delivery of products.
9607;7;"High number of resellers competing for the same market ... Low margin,
 Little control over peak price,
 Marketing on carries cost of products that start to gain market and this leaves product without competitive power."
9608;5;RTV Support
9609;6;No specific reason. I consider the note appropriate.
9610;5;BASF is giant, and I don't know what BASF we're talking about. There are divisions that have restrictions, and others that I admire. Hence my average rating.
9611;6;The service is satisfactory.
9612;5;The company provides a good service within the normal perspectives. However, we have difficulty competing with other BASF distributors, many non-branded resellers sell products at more competitive prices than ours and it seems to be a problem that will not be solved soon.
9613;7;Supplier that offers quality products.
9614;5;The company has an excellent portfolio and structure, however it lacks in distribution policy.
9615;5;FOR THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCTS
9616;5;It used to be a great supplier, but with the changes in recent years, it left something to be desired
9617;7;"Our work with BASF is recent, we can see the seriousness in the processes, trained professionals and a simple sales process.
 Having a strong point of improvement in relation to the supply of strategic products that are never available to meet the market."
9618;6;Variation in product quality
9619;5;Meets us within the standard. The point to improve and the question of collaboration between companies and internal bureaucracy, often taking a long time to get answers.
9620;6;"The lack of products at BASF is frequent and lasts for at least three years. The information arrives late and on the wrong ""team"", even informing the purchase plan far in advance.

 The portfolio is good, with great products, but there is no availability and the shortage of professionals makes it difficult to sell."
9621;5;Basf's service quality has dropped a lot lately. This is the main reason.
9622;5;Differentiated between global locations, we are trying to level differences.
9623;6;The quality of the products is exceptional, but the commercial service, price and flexibility leave something to be desired.
9624;5;"Quality products, committed staff and quick turnaround.
 Fleet used for material deliveries needs to undergo improvements."
9625;6;Variation in the quality of service when changing the contact professional. Little flexibility in certain themes, slow in some answers. Quality problems are few, but when they exist they take a long time to be solved. For existing products, competition offers almost the entire package at a lower cost (internalized imported < BASF site), with flawless logistics and without any quality problems.
9626;7;We had a very serious problem with the quality of his material that practically made Canopus lose his business in Ecuador.
9627;6;It depends on the size of the company to whom I will recommend.
9628;6;One of the main problems I see is in relation to the difficulty in communication, sometimes we send some requests and the return is too long or we often have to call to have this return. With regard to calls, we have another problem, as we often have difficulties talking to the Analysts responsible for our portfolios and we need to call several times until we are answered. Other than that, we have no problems with care, but sinning in communication is something that weighs heavily in the analysis.
9629;5;Excellent products, but the systems reliability is very low... which causes a lot of risk exposure.
9630;5;Improve the speed of technical assistance.
9631;5;"The question is lacking in detail... to recommend in what sense? Supplier / Customer / To work?
 As a supplier I consider it good, but there are many opportunities to improve the consistency of the quality of its products and technical assistance."
9632;7;The quality of BASF products
9633;6;"5 for the only serious reason we had recently with BASF. We had a quality problem with low density and curing of the Polyol material where we had two lots contaminated in our process, which ended up in the assembly line. Basf supported us technically very well Mr Tadeu followed the online tests and confirmed the origin of the problem, however Basf left something to be desired in the dynamics of replacement responses with Donaldson. It was an extremely stressful process because I didn't feel the commitment to solve the problem in restocking the new batch.
 Several obstacles were created for the customer as the BASF system is completely plastered for this type of customer support.
 Another factor taking into account this same problem is the same BASF department where they need the Invoice to request transport for non-conforming material removal that is taking up space and generating another inconvenience for their customer. In my view, as I had informed the number of drums and the weight, it was only necessary to schedule the removal of the material with your supplier because the NF Donaldson removal process does not take more than 24 hours.
 More critical was the dynamic line-stop support with Donaldson.
 But I would like to emphasize the good technical support work that Tadeu Nicodemus Ribeiro has been doing with Donaldson. Every time we needed his support he was always helpful and punctual with his customer."
9634;5;Because we need to have more clarity and agility in commercial matters.
9635;5;"Basf is a long-standing partner of ours and we still believe in this story.
 But there are two points that still need to be adjusted:
 *** Effective marketing actions and product launches, aligned with different regional realities.
 *** Profitability from resellers. With increasing spraying, the price of the brand is deteriorating and margins squeezed."
9636;7;Basf is a very dispersed and low-margin supplier. The distributor sells to anyone and at prices without much difference with whom, it buys directly from Basf.
9637;5;HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS.
9638;5;excellent product, but prices are above competitors
9639;7;Product, partnership, relationship
9640;6;Need to present better prices for catalysts.
9641;7;"Regarding the import operation, we have some open points that have already been discussed at the meeting, some resolved, others not, and when we ask BASF to officially be responsible for costs in case of deviations in the import process, they do not do it.
 They come back with the need to schedule a new meeting.

 This causes delay and waste of time for my import team."
9642;7;Good supplier, however, although some materials do not have negotiation/supply flexibility
9643;7;Delay in the feedback team, difficulty in obtaining samples, high cost.
9644;7;a little delay in answering the phones
9645;0;There is no flexibility, too many products that customers must adapt and not BASF developing to meet customer needs.
9646;0;Low availability of products for new businesses in the Brazilian market.
9647;3;In 2020, we had a very unkind situation with BASF. We closed some DMAPA orders, which were confirmed to have been met. About the date of shipment, BASF announced that it would be canceling all orders from Croda, bringing a very negative impact to our process and consequently to our customers. That is, without any empathy for the customer, BASF decided to cancel all orders for South America so that it could meet the existing demands from the United States and unexpected demands from Europe, we tried to talk to the responsible Manager to help us with the partial service. volume to minimize the negative impacts that would exist, but nothing was done. I also didn't get any Global channels of complaint for BASF's misconduct. From then on we stopped buying this item from BASF. It was one of the most regrettable situations we experienced with this organization.
9648;4;We don't get attention from our broker and the prices they give us are the same as those on the market and that way you can't work just serve the big chains and keep in mind that we sell a lot of automotive paint if not look at the free market
9649;3;The value of the product we bought more than 15 years ago is rising far above the competition
9650;3;"I do not have a valid BASF interlocutor to attend to my concerns, commercial issues, response to emails, calls, etc.

 I write, I call and I have no answers of any kind to the topics. They completely ignore me."
9651;2;"BASF Chile, which is my supplier, does not provide clear or timely responses to my needs.
 Decisions are slow, and to the extent that I insist on communicating with a valid interlocutor, they do not answer my phone or emails.
 In short, resolution management is lousy."
9652;3;No comment
9653;1;Company with little transparency of internal processes, delays deliveries in order to achieve billing goals and not in customer need!
9654;1;Product stock problems, little product mix for the area
9655;3;"Not strictly complying with what was closed, and coming later to say that there will be a lack of products.
 Change of Management placing those who do not live the day to day of Bom Futuro Agricola and failing to give opportunity to those who are already in our day to day."
9656;1;Very poor quality of the products, the technical attention does not provide the level of response expected for a company in the hierarchy of Basf, and when they request deviations committing to assume the costs, then they do not want to recognize them.
9657;0;Lack of ethics of superiors .......
9658;1;Difficulty in communication, delivery delays and too many commercial discussions for non-aligned items.
9659;4;Bad organization and logistics
9660;4;"does not fulfill the agreement
 Orders placed are not fulfilled"
9661;3;They lost the quality of relationships with those who actually sell their products.
9662;3;good morning, the reason is simple, we made a sale to a client and the tone was different in april a call with basf has already been over 60 days and nothing has been resolved every week asks me for one more thing i already sent a photo, copy of nf photo of the production and until yesterday they didn't give me a position occurrence 210920-000164
9663;2;very expensive prices for the terrible service they offer
9664;2;They have left me without raw materials.
9665;2;They are not flexible in the event of emergencies, they do not have good response capacity, there is no customer support.
9666;0;They have had product shortages for more than a year. They quote and then they don't have material to deliver, it seems like a joke ... Not very serious. The score is 4 for the quality of the products, otherwise it would be 0.
9667;1;We were partners for 03 years and at the moment we needed it most, BASF stopped supplying 100%. Left our factory idle for 30 days and was responsible for a 40% reduction in our billing in the last 12 months.
9668;3;"Today Suvinil is the most expensive paint on the market.
 The products are never ready for delivery.
 The least profitable ink.
 Competitors sell cheaper than buying from the factory itself.
 One-sided sales policy.
 The most aggressive brand on the market.
 We had a 25-year job, and simply, we were excluded by the pricing policy.
 It has a discriminatory policy in the delivery of its products, whoever is SELF, has preference to receive the products."
9669;3;Highly competitive products, but strong candidates with equal quality at lower cost.
9670;2;He doesn't care about the client in Brazil. It closes the market for South America when profit is higher in America.
9671;3;BASF favors distribution more than a direct customer. It's getting more and more complicated to work.
9672;4;The products are very good, however there is a long delay in quotes.
9673;4;Product availability has been a problem for more than 1 year, we have not managed to have a stable commercial relationship over time
9674;0;they do not have product generally
9675;4;UNFORTUNATELY THEY DO NOT MEET THE SHIPPING DEADLINES - DELAYS OF MORE THAN 120 / 180 DAYS.-
9676;4;There are no doubts about the quality of the products and technical knowledge of the referents, but logistics and times are always a great inconvenience.
9677;3;Long delay in responding to a query
9678;3;Non-compliance with deliveries due to lack of product
9679;3;We have problems with many purchase orders placed.
9680;4;"- Bad problem solving
 - Lack of clarity and transparency of information
 - Constant shortages of products"
9681;4;Due to the non-compliance with the negotiation agreements carried out in the acquisition of seed for the 2019/20 crop.
9682;2;Lack of better presence in operations and management model needs to be defined together to obtain better results. Today is very reactive
9683;4;Incoherent commercial conditions and poor product availability.
9684;2;"Good morning,

 We buy and import from BASF and run out of products.

 Fernando"
9685;0;"It takes time to confirm some volumes/products.
 Shortages
 Price above market."
9686;1;Problems reaching requested dates and inventory not available
9687;0;Because they are very slow to respond and make decisions and they rarely fulfill commercial promises.
9688;2;The commercial policy applied has been a disaster in our market, the new marketer has come out to destroy the margins, currently doing business below our cost.
9689;4;In recent times, BASF is not protecting marketers, measures are taken that only benefit BASF and in a commercial relationship, mutual benefit is important.
9690;3;It is a company that wants to apply the rules of the first world and does not realize that it is in Argentina, apart as a client that I was always I had the feeling that they are not interested in the least.
9691;1;From August-2020 to the present, BASF has not fulfilled the deliveries of the emulsions in a timely manner. For an industrial company, the fulfillment of the supply, and the trust in its suppliers, is a fundamental requirement to be able to operate (and more in key materials such as emulsions), since if it does not directly affect our production, and therefore to our clients.
9692;3;The bad communication with the Representatives and the feedback of the orders placed with BASF that do not respond is consequent, it is necessary to be sending emails.
9693;3;Actually, although we started a very good relationship with BASF, communication has become very difficult, we understand what is happening worldwide, but it takes weeks to respond to emails, to give quotes or sometimes they simply never answer
9694;2;You don't have the same quality of service anymore. It was once a company that was proud to be a partner.
9695;4;Good morning, in relation to the current scenario, Basf has prices that do not match the market.
9696;2;At this moment, BASF deliveries are the worst, with delays and delivery problems.
9697;2;Price wars between distributors make the profitability of the line very unprofitable. They seem to be concerned only with the short term. They have value-added products but they market them as if they were generics and the margins end up being generic. They do not have a sufficient presence in the field and are not in a position to compensate with the presence of committed distributors because who wants to commit to a company that is not profitable?
9698;3;Lack of empathy for the customer
9699;4;"I was a great driver of BASF within my company, improving the control works of Sphenophorus levis and BASF did not support me in the development of the quality of the application technologies in rigs, where I use her product. other than that, I have no support in the development of other BASF technologies that I consider differentiated in the market, such as foliar fungicides and azospirilum.

 There is a lot of share space for BASF that is not explored here due to a lack of monitoring and technical development,"
9700;3;"Lately I have a lot of problems with the Suvinil brand, I am a customer who has been buying materials in large volumes for over 22 years.
 To describe all that I have of dissatisfaction would spend a lot of time and maybe not use this channel.

 I am available for a meeting
"
9701;1;BASF does not listen to the arguments of distributors, RTVs and managers have no autonomy for anything, it is inflexible in negotiations and practices enormous price dispersion between distributors and direct sales.
9702;4;Attention and very late response on important matters.
9703;2;"Little support, very distant.
 Non-competitive prices."
9704;0;Very long lead time for supply, unreliable in fulfilling orders in a timely manner. Lack of communication
9705;1;Delivery times are disastrous !!
9706;2;Today the chemical business in general in terms of street margins are very bad. In the end, the farmer is the one who sets the price for the product. and it does not deliver any added value to the margin. and few people value the advice or the agronomic value. so there is no need to recommend products indistinctly by the brand.
9707;1;So that they are not future competition
9708;0;Deliveries never deliver on the requested dates, and they don't keep their own promises. And when there is a quality problem the delay to solve it takes weeks.
9709;0;"We have noticed that the level of service is not required.
 Delivery follow-ups are low and claims are high"
9710;1;"Company totally uninterested in the growth or in the transparency and variables of its clientele. Knowing the client's reality, the reality of their intentions and planning.
 A company that because of the information I absorb in the market. It denotes its customers and certain arrogance and is totally segmented and that it will hardly be an integrated company, no matter how good its system and how better its professionals are, as this is a matter of business administrative vision.
 Your decisions are very selfish and self-centered always based 100% on your own navel. And your customers hour interesting disposable hour.
 I believe there are few competitors, maybe that's why the strategy,
 Any competing initiative to compete in the same market, at this point you would lose the negotiation.
 big hug."
9711;2;Lack of problem solving.
9712;4;We are aware of the lack of raw materials in the world, but BASF has stopped supplying our factory and we are currently out of options and at risk of ending operations after 20 years of work.
9713;2;poor management of the sales and supplies team. the customer has to adapt to the basf policy and not the other way around. in relation to the distributor, we expect a partnership, but this is definitely not what happens on a daily basis.
9714;4;"I have been working with Suvinil for 25 years, today it is the worst company on my list of suppliers!!
 It imposes a unilateral negotiation, where the customer is totally dissatisfied, has the lowest profitability, never has ready delivery products, you oblige you to have a gigantic stock.
 The suvinil today, thinks it can do anything, BUT, it forgot that its customers need to be heard, and there is no BRAND, which can keep itself in the market with such a totalitarian policy!!!"
9715;2;many changes in sales staff
9716;0;"Great difficulty for the supplier in making commercial technical agreements for the release of prototypes, with a continuous need for monitoring in the escalation process so that the client can have parts for internal tests
 Difficulty of the supplier in following up the project, with delay in important deliveries such as PPAP, bringing strong risks to the launch of the project at the client"
9717;4;They stopped meeting our requirements for more than 6 months! That makes us think that the limited availability of product worldwide was delivered to its large customers and the small ones have left us aside.
9718;0;The communication channel is distant and reactive to delivery inquiries
9719;2;"The communication has not been timely, nor reliable, they make changes without being informed in time to take action.
 Lately attention has deteriorated, very poor communication and the responses requested."
9720;1;The portfolio is little solution for the farmer
9721;4;"The AGREGA Program is horrible. And nobody at BASF listens to us for changes. We don't get the attention it deserves. Only field personnel are attentive and helpful, but they do not have the ""power"" to change."
9722;3;More present support is lacking.
9723;2;Today I would not recommend BASF because of the supply problems they present. We are also not satisfied with the speed to solve the problems that arose.
9724;2;They could improve the times of imports of their products. I have nothing to say about customer service, always excellent.
9725;1;Because there is no coordination with the seller and the consumer.
9726;0;Despite having first-rate products, almost unable to bring any problems to the user, Basf brings to the market harmful commercial policies, which destroy value of the entire chain and which comes against the market
9727;2;Tecun El Salvador we have received a bad service since there is no art attention from BASF, there have been changes and we were never notified, we made purchases and we realized that the products were already shared with another distributor and the worst thing is that the permit expired to import and only the new distributor was notified and Tecun was not informed and it could not be imported, the representatives are called and they do not answer and solve the problems and are giving negative Tecun qualifications.
9728;1;"Our company has been a client of BASF for more than 10 years, in that decade we have dedicated a very considerable amount of human and financial resources to develop many products. Suddenly all that effort vanishes due to the ""OPENING OF BUSINESS"".

 The low margins with which we have been compelled to work with BASF products do not make their commercialization sustainable.

 BASF has dedicated itself to overstocking our warehouses no matter how deadly that practice is to the financial health of our organization."
9729;3;Because our experience with BASF has been unfavorable in many business respects. Eg. They make us sales and sales proposals without thinking about our business if not only thinking about BASF and for it to be a business, both parties must win.
9730;2;Very bad communication,
9731;4;"because they do not deliver the supplies with the requested useful life conditions, even sending purchase orders one year in advance.
 because before emergencies they cannot respond in an agile and fast way."
9732;3;"Their products are Excellent but the attention is TERRIBLE, we are numbers.
 After 16 years of experience with BASF I only stay with their products, the rest why there is much more to say is unnecessary, you know more than I can personally describe, and just to take into account my name is Leonardo GAZZIA. Cordial greeting"
9733;3;Service a disaster
9734;2;The bureaucracy that the company has means that we cannot access all the knowledge and products worldwide, each request takes too long to be answered and many times it is not answered at all. There is very little flexibility in care.
9735;0;"Basf sells to a distributor in my city, so they don't sell me a polyol, tdi, copolymer !!!

 I work today importing directly and buying covestro, my consumption today is 100 tons of polyol, 75 tons of tdi, 9 tons of copolymer month ... payment method 14 days.

 I hope that after that answer, someone from Basf can see this situation because I always looked for you so that I could have Basf as a supplier too. But Mr. Sérgio and Mr. Rafael never gave me the opportunity!

 Thank you for doing the research and letting me out."
9736;2;It depends on the size of the colleague's company, if it is a small company they will not serve it
9737;3;We have been giving Basf a 6-month forcast service and there have been frequent delays in the delivery of Lauril Pasta.
9738;1;Low level of service and customer care, very long waiting times.
9739;0;We were not very supported by the pandemic and there was a disproportionate price increase
9740;1;Basf does not respond to the requests and recommendations for improvement of the CoA, we already know that it is a global coA, but the minimum GMP deliverables (city of the manufacturing site, useful life and expiration date) should always be included.
9741;1;THERE IS NO ATTENTION OR SUPPORT, NO UPDATES, NO TECHNICAL VISITS, NOT EVEN PHONE CALLS, WE ARE WORKING WITHOUT SAMPLES, SPECTRUM WITHOUT BATTERY SPARE PARTS .....
9742;1;Because they don't get involved in the problem
9743;0;It is a company where profitability levels ceased to exist, although I as an advisor recommend the products, the advised producer always finds the cheapest products.
9744;2;I never got the interview and I would have liked to rate my salesperson, his attention is terrible
9745;0;Improve customer contact.
9746;0;LOYALTY, COLLABORATION, SUPPORT
9747;2;My answer is with the look of a dealer's land seller, this is due to the lack of trust and transparency with zonal with respect to the businesses of certain clients.
9748;0;Because the prices that the competition has in their products that sell everything at least 20 to 25% negative margin, they have no incentive to recommend Basf products, being of good quality, but it is the reality that we have in Los Angeles
9749;1;Because these problems have already been reported numerous times for everyone who questions us. Unfortunately, we have not seen any favorable position for improvement.
9750;3;For the above reason, commercial policy is very bad, as there is no price control work at the end, no one actually manages it at the end. Save yourself whoever you can.
9751;0;Lack of response, delivery of delayed documentation, status of the cargo in a timely manner
9752;1;WE DON'T HAVE A SERVICE SUPPORT, ALWAYS IN OUR REGION WE ARE ABANDONED, EVERY TIME WE ARE IN THE Q WE WERE WITHOUT A CONSULTANT, I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE A GREATER SUPPORT, WHENEVER WE HAVE ANY PROJECT IN PROGRESS WE HAVE TO STOP AND START ZERO DATE AGAIN, GIVING SPACE FOR OTHER BRANDS TO ENTER THE MARKET.
9753;1;I don't see BASF close to its customers
9754;3;"Unfortunately we no longer do business with Basf , we consume their products through AD and PG distributors , IMCD .
 We feel neglected by BASF when informing that we would have to have a minimum consumption of
 400 thousand Euros per year"
9755;4;sloppy customer service
9756;2;BASF is a very good supplier, but due to its complex and sometimes authoritarian internal policies, they do not encourage corporations to expand the portfolio in Scandinavia Pharma purchases, one of the reasons for not having it within commercial allies is the refusal to expand payment term taking into account the volume of purchases that we have with BASF.
9757;4;Very confusing company.
9758;4;"The logistics area is very deficient; There are no products, they dispatch incomplete POs, they do not provide information in real time."
9759;2;Due to the new commercial policy that favors a large national group, which has an exclusive discount rate in the ello category.
9760;2;"1. From my perspective, unfair trade policy:
 a) Small BASF store with reduced portfolio buying 6% cheaper through the Mundial distributor (campaigns buy 10 cans and get 1);
 b) New entrant (MC Paints) buying up to 14% cheaper;

 * Consequently, 2019 was the year in which we granted the largest discount on Suvinil products, causing a drop in margin and the need to recover this loss of profitability in other suppliers.

 c) 90-day interest-free period for the competitor;
 d) Sales in the old table 30 days after the table was turned over with the competitor's justification for not having a DC (Distribution Center). Inconsistency because whoever invests in the business (who has CD) is penalized.
 e) Weakening of the ELO program. Lack of transparency or perception of management policy in sight.
 f) Commercial and strategic proposal less attractive than other suppliers in the segment.

 2. There is a need for better training of the sales team
 a) When questioning the price difference that the competitor practices in selling to the consumer, the answer is another question: ""Do you know the volume that MC buys nationwide?"". There is inconsistency because obviously the participation of the new entrant in GO is smaller. And regional players do not compete in other markets (such as SP);
 b) There is no gratitude when the goals are reached, but there is a very aggressive and hostile demand when they are not; A real connection between sell in and sell out is missing. If you don't sell due to unfair commercial policy, it's no use charging sell in.
 c) The team lacks the value of simplicity.

 3. There is a lack of better training for the merchandising team
 a) Merchandising promoter rated all stores in the chain with a star on Google;
 b) Lack of professionalism with excessive proximity (case manager Rosimeire / Castelo Branco store: ""Good morning, brunette / beautiful marvelous"");
 c) Rudeness in the reopening of the T-63 store when using a product with the label of Melotintas' biggest competitor (Unitintas) in the application of products to a large number of final consumers and painters.
 d) Very low involvement in the reopening of the store: Arrived late, all wet/sweaty, did not do the texture and color plates (texture and color palette); On the eve, we hired a painter to make the Marble and Touch of Glitter apps.
 e) No involvement in the new store (Castelo Branco).

 4. From a strategic point of view:
 a) Conflict with the Distribution channel lasts for more than 5 years: Channel that has no success cases in the segment in the region of Goiânia. There are several cases of failure both with Suvinil products (Luma, Mécari, Mundial) and with other brands (3M, Renner, etc.); On average, the business barely reached 5 years.
 b) Low historical knowledge in the region: Common characteristic of those who were leaders in the region (Coral, Suvinil, Leinertex): all without the distribution channel, buying with a transparent and coherent policy."
9761;4;BASF is an excellent company to work for, but as a supplier it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of delivery and service information.
9762;2;In the region in which I am part of agribusiness, we have pricing very different from Direct Sales, with these pricing it is increasingly difficult for distribution to play the important role of services and capillarity in the area. We need a more industry-adjusted final fallout.
9763;1;A company with excellent products, however, has not served well in terms of deliveries, that is, in agriculture, the timing is definitive for the success of hits or misses..
9764;0;Low price competitiveness
9765;4;Lack of product, support and price
9766;1;"For the simple reason that Basf is now one of our competitors, selling to construction companies, condominiums, among others.
 We resellers cannot compete directly with the industry, thus making an unequal fight.
 So there is no way to refer a friend or colleague, it would be easier to refer to a competitor."
9767;4;Good afternoon, I was an exclusive partner, for many years, but for 4 years now, it has been very complicated to compete with customers served by distribution, we as ink cartridges need to maintain various services such as: fast delivery, training for painters, paint and stock consultants of all items and volume. Today the profit margin is very low.
9768;4;A company that has great growth potential due to the quality of its products, unfortunately the management is not the best.
9769;3;We work with many BASF products and the truth is that it is complicated since you have to talk with each sector corresponding to your product and also the difficulty for them to sell us some products
9770;2;Bad service
9771;3;They have depleted the Ibuprofen market without giving any explanation and permanently delaying deliveries. On the other hand, after returning to production, they reported a price increase.
9772;0;Ibuprofen market shortage on several occasions over two years, little transparent information in this regard.
9773;4;As they are commodity products, they do not have a competitive price
9774;4;AT THE TIME IT IS NOT MEETING THE DISTRIBUTOR'S EXPECTATIONS VERY LOW TIP PRICES
9775;2;Delivery of Expired Material, non-compliance with Delivery Dates.
9776;1;Good variety of products globally and very poor quality in Argentina
9777;2;Lack of product, difficult delivery, non-fulfillment of promises.
9778;4;He has been let down many times by trusting
9779;3;The Company strives to make the sale claiming that the product will rise due to the exchange rate. I buy, the exchange rate takes off (3.79 -> 4.15) and the product falls in price in R $. I should have thought it was good, because the input fell and I'm a producer, but I remember the conversation and arguments at the time of the sale and I reflect for the future ..........
9780;0;Today we have Basf supply a very low spend item, which we were unable to pass on to a distributor due to exclusive contracts Basf has with distributors. In addition, as we have to continue with the BASF supply, there is an incredible delay for the simple signing of a contractual term - not a legal contract, but a simple contractual term.
9781;0;"It is increasingly difficult to work with BASF. The difference in pricing between resale and direct sales is very large. This affects our market a lot. Any small customer in the region buys at the levels we buy or even better. Product migrates from other locations to our region due to price differences and we are ""thieves"" here. They talk so much about adding value, but VD is only price."
9782;2;"Communication is only made with the Board of Companies.
 They don't pay attention to the people who actually sell their products."
9783;0;THERE IS NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN THE AREA
9784;0;Your portfolio is very good, your people do not build trust in the long term.
9785;4;Very poor after-sales service and resolution of quality problems
9786;0;commercial negotiation
9787;1;In my opinion, they don't care about the customer. They don't give you a chance to listen to the client's side. I don't have anything to complain about my consultant, but the only channel I have for any complaints is him, and I realize that he is limited to many actions. It seems that there is a sales policy, but it is not followed. We are tired of seeing resellers selling at very low prices, prices that it is impossible to keep up with. My score is 4 because the company has good, quality products, a product that I do want to have in my store and that I do want to sell. But unfortunately, the negotiation, the ways in which the goals are imposed, without any concern for the customer's needs, has generated a great deal of dissatisfaction in relation to Basf. A relationship that should be a partnership I cannot visualize. On the contrary, unfortunately the feeling I have is that I have a supplier that plays against us.
9788;1;The products are excellent, brand consolidated. But a lot of negotiation difficulty (currently). With unrealistic goals and there is no revision of those goals. Due to the discount policy, even working with a margin below the minimum, smaller resellers are out of the market. Does not provide necessary profitability.
9789;2;The last year and a half they have not responded as expected. The quality is still there but that is no longer a plus, that is already the average or the minimum that one would expect. They have been failing to fulfill order after order and have left us without material on several occasions with a firm OC more than 4 months in advance.
9790;0;1 month ago we closed a direct import operation and it had to be shipped before September 30. 2 weeks ago we made the advance payment and now they inform us that they do not have the full amount required and that we must wait 3 weeks for it to be ready, when they had confirmed that it was immediately available. Therefore, they are not reliable suppliers since we expected to have the material in Argentina by October 29 at the latest and with the new news they gave us, I do not think we can have the merchandise until the end of November.
9791;2;There is no respect for distributors
9792;0;The lack of personalized attention, which makes the client feel that it is important
9793;4;Bad attention a lot of bureaucracy
9794;4;Customer Service delivery dates are not reliable.
9795;1;"Difficulty in solving problems related to the delivery of key product from the management of a plant.
 In the Regent case"
9796;3;Basically in my business relationship with this company
9797;4;Little personalized attention, slow responses,
9798;0;I would not recommend basf because we were isolated from small distributors, for basf only distributors who do not have a warehouse and handle large scales of products are counted and they have been in charge of damaging the market by giving better prices than those offered by basf to distributors.
9799;3;YOUR POLICIES ARE VERY DIFFICULT FOR NEGOTIATIONS
9800;3;are not partners
9801;1;They have too many distributors, the profitability in the sale of their products is very low, the products that already have generics are very expensive compared to the competition and there is still no demand for their new products.
9802;0;"We have requested advice on products for the paper industry without receiving a response.
 It seems that they only care about the sales volume."
9803;2;Customer service is distant, there is no fluid feedback
9804;4;Low product offer and bad service
9805;3;"They do not value the work we do as marketers of their products.
 Very little presence of its officials in our company.
 Discriminatory policies in the management of the product portfolio and discounts that favor distributors from other areas so that they penetrate, breaking prices in other markets that are being well served by the marketer in the area."
9806;2;As Coagra los angeles we do not have price conditions to compete with MV, so I do not recommend Basf products
9807;0;Very different conditions with our competition
9808;1;Doesn't fulfill its commitments
9809;1;The company does not meet product delivery deadlines and has no pricing policy
9810;1;"- The delay in responding to commercial conditions.
 - lack of competitiveness vis-à-vis cooperatives.
 -Blindance of customers who have done the work in the past and this year another channel sold, and on top of that they took away a complete BASF portfolio that took 2 harvests to convince, replacing it with Syngenta (BELA Agrícola), this was unacceptable.
 I have been working with BASF for 10 years and I am seeing it increasingly cannibalize its customers (resale), this change in territory management forces a creation of each one for you."
9811;3;Lack of information on product delivery (Aprinza, Fipronil, etc.)
9812;0;The prices are high. It does not have programs that interact with companies.
9813;2;because they have a very bad logistics, even when buying more than 6 months in advance, they cannot deliver the products with the useful life I need
9814;1;Unfortunately, the sending of samples is very slow, there are abstention problems, and the technical responses are very slow.
9815;1;There is no quick return on inquiries, or information on the status of orders, copies of documents do not arrive on time and orders are placed differently than indicated, having to request modifications
9816;1;"It seems to me a supplier with poor communication, usually the information initially given changes, it does not generate security or confidence when issuing a purchase order and additionally it seems to me that they have no sense of urgency.

 Your logistics and planning process is disorganized."
9817;4;"It is a company with good products ... but it does not align with the competition ""large laboratory strategies""
 Is getting outdated"
9818;4;low presence and no commercial conditions
9819;0;great difficulty with logistics, due to the products billed that take time to be delivered.
9820;3;FOR THE DELAY OF THE RESPONSE AND SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMS THAT HAPPENS FOR GIVING US RETURN.
9821;3;It is very difficult to enter into a business relationship. They never visited us and finally told us that they could no longer sell us direct. Our consumptions were increasing so we were surprised by their decision.
9822;1;Very little accompaniment to distributors
9823;2;Bad attention, I am waiting for a battery from a spectrophotometer for more than 1 year, they do not visit customers, I do not have color updates, samples, sales tools, a disaster
9824;2;There is no greater variety of products
9825;0;We are a reseller representing BASF agricultural products in URUGUAYANA-RS and currently our area is being invaded with BASF products from other resellers that are not authorized to sell in our area and still selling at a price well below the BASF commercial price list, so totally off in accordance with company policies. We would like to know what actions the company will take with respect to this.
9826;4;Communication with the client is not good (flyers or Big do not contribute much). The non-existent seller and technical service leaves much to be desired. Prices completely out of date with respect to the competition.
9827;1;I'm still waiting for an answer about the delays this year in bicarbonate
9828;2;It is the qualification that we consider to be consistent.
9829;2;lousy, disorganized service, full of errors
9830;3;"They do not respect the agreed commercial conditions.
 Abusive rates apply"
9831;3;Lack of knowledge of the technical area about the products it imports
9832;2;the lack of interest in the proposed development
9833;4;At the startup of Basf's partnership with Powercoat, there were many problems in the process causing great wear and tear, including the service to Powercoat customers was compromised. Today, the problems have almost all been solved, however, we have high costs for stripping paint devices in general, which creates operational problems. Basf was called in to help us on the topic, but the problem was posed as Powercoat (drag) and we were unable to evolve.
9834;4;inadequate pricing policy and no guarantee of supply
9835;1;Customer service does not exist, neglect is explicit, lack of information, etc.
9836;0;Failure to deliver on the scheduled date, lack of communication and major losses in our production due to lack of raw materials.
9837;0;Weak commercial support. Delay in sending commercial proposals. Commercial proposals sent are not the most competitive as they do not use the best route / sourcing. Lack of initiative and resoluteness in problems of supply or availability of materials.
9838;2;I had a case where BASF refused to take responsibility for the problem.
9839;4;I have not received any returns regarding my requests via email.
9840;4;Service, accuracy in sending information
9841;1;Catalyst price has increased a lot and is far above direct competitors. Since BASF does not have any follow-up in Brazil to analyze the conversion in loco, and offer the service of a screening partner, and also provide other equipment for aggregation in the sulfuric acid plants. Indeed, competitors have a bigger package to offer, and price is the most important.
9842;0;Little flexibility in negotiations. No opening for progress in new businesses.
9843;1;Delay in the return of a development! Low interest in serving customers!
9844;1;Various quality and service issues after the merger are solemn
9845;4;Products supplied outside the specification range, causing a lot of instability in the process.
9846;3;"Good Morning!!

 Although Basf is our flagship, pricing for the next harvest was unfeasible, and another problem is the lack of product, it's very exhausting to work in this way."
9847;3;It never gives economic viability. ends up generating engineering capacity expenditure without application potential
9848;0;"It does not present flexibility in negotiations making the business uncompetitive.
 There are no improvements or cost reduction activities.
 He has no interest in seeking alternatives to make the business more competitive.
 Although we are developing a new product globally, we are not interested in following the same supplier to Brazil."
9849;4;Due to recent problems with the supply of Joncryl 2090.
